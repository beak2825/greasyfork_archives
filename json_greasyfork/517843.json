  "description": "Disables travel for individual countries if you do not have enough to purchase plushies/flowers. This choice will be made by whichever is more expensive. Edit the numbers inside the script if you will need less/more for each country, and the travel capacity if yours is not 29. Switzerland is set to 500k for two rehab sessions. This doesn't take into account the ticket cost in standard flights.",
