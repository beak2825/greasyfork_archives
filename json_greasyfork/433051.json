  "description": "I mainly wrote this in 2021 to enable TamperMonkey to continue using scripts that have `@require` dependencies on sites with a restrictive `Trusted-Types` policy, until TM v4.14 came out (milestone: https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey/issues/1334#event-5361683856). Now it seems like some cases make it relevant again? I think that should be only temporary until the TM team get on top of what ever changed. Make sure this script is executed before the `@require`ing of any dependencies",
