Not all accounts are available in the linked tools and this script does not attempt to verify before generating links. This script is not intended to harm or harass or gatekeep. This script is intended to automate a process which was tedious to execute for each user. Killproof.me is completely Opt-In. WingmanKP requires one person from the group to upload the log. This script is not associated with either.",
