    "description": "This script automatically finds messages sent by bots in Tango.me chats and lets you delete them in bulk. It adds an easy-to-use button to the Tango chat interface. Clicking the button shows a list of bot-related chats, which you can delete with a single confirmation. A progress indicator appears during deletion, and you’ll be notified about how many chats were deleted or failed to delete. The script offers a simple and user-friendly experience for quick chat cleanup.",
