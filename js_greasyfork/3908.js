// @description	This script was deleted from Greasy Fork, and due to its negative effects, it has been automatically removed from your browser.

// This is just a modification of Callum Locke's script at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/55185 and Kelly Nielsen modification at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/74583
// ...but adjusted by Jon Murphy at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/121888 so it will work for Google Chrome.
// Updated again by Brian Pilnick to function properly with recent Amazon updates. Jon's version breaks image viewing and didn't always succeed to make a valid referral link. Still doesn't catch every amazon link however.

// On Chrome, manually set the associateID below, as greasemonkey (GM_) functions won't work.
