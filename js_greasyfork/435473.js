  let reviews = {"Faithbound Judge": {"Rate": "5.0", "Desc": "This is very difficult to attack through early on, and then turns into a Serra Angel a few turns down the line. That alone is a fantastic deal for three mana. However, what makes this insane is that your opponent can't kill it unless they have an answer to an enchantment or are able to end the game incredibly quickly. Seven is a lot, but this is insanely hard to answer and is going to be near unbeatable on most board states, so I would never under any circumstances pass this and would not be surprised if it was the best limited card in the entire set."}, "Cemetery Protector": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This will often be able to ambush a creature in combat and then start accruing a nice stream of creatures for you. If you end up exiling a land you get to live the dream of making your own Emeria Angel! Being able to hit any graveyard also makes it unlikely for this to have no targets while also making it a stellar answer to a graveyard synergy that your opponent is trying to pull off. I don't foresee myself passing this often."}, "Savior of Ollenbock": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "Wow, you better kill this quickly otherwise your board is going to be decimated and your window to profitably kill this will close. Sure this exiles your opponent creatures, which is great, but what really interests me is exiling creatures from your own graveyard with this so even if it is answered, you still get a bunch of value from reanimating some of your creatures. It's also nice that this clears the way for itself when you attack and Train it, so I foresee this playing incredibly well and being very difficult to beat."}, "Welcoming Vampire": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "I'll definitely take a Mentor of the Meek with Flying! You trade being able to trigger Mentor of the Meek as many times a turn as you want with a way better body and no activation cost, which makes this a good amount better in my opinion. You should never run out of cards for as long this lives, which make it a must answer, insanely powerful bomb."}, "By Invitation Only": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "A five mana wrath with upside is going to be great on just about every board state. I like that you can play this and clear an opponent's horde of creatures while still keeping your bomb in play. Not to mention that this plays around Indestructible tricks like Adamant Will since your opponent is sacrificing instead of destroying their creatures."}, "Angelic Quartermaster": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "We're starting off strong here with a pretty fantastic finisher for any white deck. This is a beefy, flying Saddleback Lagac that leaves behind some decent value even if it is answered. I see a lot of games ending quickly once Quartermaster hits the battlefield, so I wouldn't expect to be passing this often. It takes a lot for a five drop to impress me in Limited since late game plays are a dime in a dozen, but this is the exception and more than delivers."}, "Katilda, Dawnhart Martyr": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is fine even as a 1/1 Flying, Lifelink, Protection from Vampires, but I can see this getting big in the late game as you deploy more spirits and enchantments. The disturb side is also great because it makes another huge threat for you, so I expect this to be a very powerful rare to start a draft with."}, "Lantern Flare": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Only being able to hit creatures is a bummer, but this is still a solid removal spell whether you're Boros or just playing white. It's going to be especially brutal in racing situations when you can pay the Cleave cost though now that's for sure!"}, "Wedding Announcement": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This either draws you cards or makes 1/1's, both of which are solid. By the time this flips into Glorious Anthem, you'll either have made three 1/1's, drawn three cards, or some mix of the two, all of which seem very good. Global pump effects are always at their best in limited, so I expect this to be fantastic nearly every time that it's cast. The only downside is that this can be a little slow to flip, but it is nice at least that this triggers on your end step instead of upkeep."}, "Circle of Confinement": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I'll definitely take a Silkwrap with irrelevant bonus text! A sweet situational removal spell with sweet flavor that I'm always going to play but will rarely be blown away with."}, "Distracting Geist": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a great creature in any deck that should open up combat and make it way easier to Train your creatures!"}, "Fierce Retribution": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Both of these modes combine to make a solid removal spell. If you're behind you're able to kill an attacker and manage the board, and if you're ahead you can pay the Cleave cost and push your advantage. I think you're going to be seeing a lot of this card throughout your time playing the format."}, "Fleeting Spirit": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This isn't nearly as good as Adanto Vanguard or Seasoned Hallowblade, but it still looks good to me! Discarding a card to blink it makes this a decent blocker at times, but what really interests me is giving this First Strike, picking off their attacker or blocker, and then blinking out Fleeting Spirit to save it. Three cards is a real cost though, so I don't think you'll be able to activate this more than once or twice a game. Fleeting Spirit is still an insanely cool design that I can't wait to play with in draft!"}, "Gryff Rider": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "A solid flier that grows as the game goes on is the exact kind of card that you're going to be gunning to have as many copies as possible in your aggressive decks. It's also nice that even if you don't trigger Training, this is still serviceable as a 2/1 Flier. I love prioritizing cards with a high floor and a high ceiling, especially when they're so good at fueling other cards with the set mechanic!"}, "Gryffwing Cavalry": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Training this feisty bird is going to be trivial since you can give flying to whatever huge beater that you want this to train with. The initial body is small, but this is so good at beating down that I have high hopes for it."}, "Hopeful Initiate": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Training this early on is when it's going to overperform, but I worry about how mediocre this is later on in the game when the board gets clogged. I do like that it provides incidental answers to artifacts and enchantments and that this can use counters from any creature, but I doubt this is going to perform as well as I'm hoping for."}, "Panicked Bystander": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Holy beans, and the award of the creepiest card in the entire set goes to\u2026 Panicked Bystander! My goodness is the flavor here beyond scary. This is still an excellent card that every white deck will want considering that it turns into a huge, near impossible to profitably block Zulaport Cutthroat."}, "Resistance Squad": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Now this is a white three drop. This is a top notch three drop in any human deck seeing as a three mana 3/2 that draws a card is way above rate. I know that I'm gonna roll my eyes in disgust when my opponent curves a two drop human into this!"}, "Sigarda's Imprisonment": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Oh no, my favorite Innistrad angel ain't doing too good! Ah jeez, regardless this is just Luminous Bonds with upside, which I'm always going to play in my white decks."}, "Sigarda's Summons": {"Rate": "3*", "Desc": "This is going to be awful in most decks, but if you have a lot of Train and counter synergies then feel free to play this and try to live the dream! The payoff is definitely there if you get it to work. This kind of reminds me of Divine Visitation, so keep that in mind when you're trying to build around it."}, "Thalia, Guardian of Thraben": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "One of my favorite cards of all time! Unlike in constructed however, her second ability isn't normally that stellar since most Limited decks (including yours) will have 7+ noncreature spells in it. Regardless, a 2/1 First Strike is still solid and this is going to be particularly punishing if you end up playing against some of the slower blue and black decks of the format."}, "Twinblade Geist": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This works very well with Drogskol Infantry, Traveling Minister, and a whole bunch of commons in white which makes me optimistic about the power level of Fencing Ace in this set. The Disturb side should also be especially difficult to beat when it's on a big flier or lifelinker."}, "Valorous Stance": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Another really sweet reprint right here. Creature protection and situational removal stapled together end up making a very solid spell, so I'd happily play this in every white deck. It's just so versatile and it never hurts to have extra answers to some of the huge demons and dragons of this set."}, "Voice of the Blessed": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This more often than not is just going to be a harder to cast Ajani's Pridemate, but that's not a bad floor to have! If you end up having a consistent way to gain life, then this will easily take over the game once it gets four counters on it. If you take this, definitely start taking Traveling Ministers way more highly."}, "Drogskol Infantry": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "White has a lot of solid common two drops, which makes me optimistic about the color's ability to be aggressive. I'd happily play as many of these as possible since they leave behind value after trading and help grow a flier and keep Training triggering."}, "Estwald Shieldbasher": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This hits hard and is impossible to profitably block once it's Indestructible. I expect to see a lot of these from the aggressive human based decks of the format since this is an amazing way to Train your creatures!"}, "Heron of Hope": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "A nice bread and butter playable right here. Gaining three life per hit is good, and a 2/3 Flier for four is passable. For reference, I would assume that this is about as good as Sunmane Pegasus was in Theros Beyond Death."}, "Heron-Blessed Geist": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "A 3/3 Flying for five is playable but unexciting, but being able to turn this into more fliers after it dies brings it's value way up. Needing to have an enchantment is annoying, but it's nice that by the time you want to get the spirits out of this, the game will probably already have dragged on to the point where you have an enchantment or two out."}, "Kindly Ancestor": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Nothing too flashy or powerful here, but a nice filler for whatever deck you're playing, especially if it's going to be slower. Also look at the flavor, it's so sweet!"}, "Parish-Blade Trainee": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Now this is a two drop that I'm happy to play! It should be easy to start Training this up, and it's great that you get value after it trades off. This is exactly the type of creature that I want to be filling my aggressive white decks with. Keep in mind that the Training mechanic makes fliers way more valuable because they are way more likely to be able to attack profitably and trigger all your Training creatures."}, "Nurturing Presence": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Two mana for a 1/1 Flier isn't great, but this could help buff a creature and get it profitably attacking and triggering Training, which makes this somewhat interesting. I'm skeptical and assume that this will underperform, but I'll need to try it out in order to confirm that it is indeed mediocre, but still playable."}, "Piercing Light": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Righteous Blow was always mediocre but playable, and I assume that adding a Scry one won't change much. Creatures are a lot bigger nowadays, but I still like that this is able to kill Training creatures with ease because they tend to start out small."}, "Ollenbock Escort": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "A non-evasive one mana 1/1 isn't great, but this does get better once you start filling your deck with a bunch of creatures with Training. Still, I see a lot of situations where this is unable to protect the creature that I want it to, which is disappointing and why I'm not too high on it."}, "Traveling Minister": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This feels very difficult to accurately evaluate, because I've honestly never seen a card that's similar to this. Personally, I think that it's going to perform well because it pecks in early on, gains a decent chunk of life, and then opens up a lot of attacks that trigger all your Training creatures. That's a lot for only one mana! I love the design here and am looking forward to trying it out!"}, "Vampire Slayer": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "There are a lot of vampires in Crimson Vow, but at the end of the day this is still going to just be a 2/2 for two with Deathtouch like 25% of the time. That's not great, but also not bad so don't be concerned about filling your curve in with this when you're in dire need of some early game."}, "Adamant Will": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This is clunky and mediocre, but it'll still get the job done if you're aggressive, low on removal, and in need of some ways to push your creatures through."}, "Arm the Cathars": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "I could definitely be wrong here, but this is giving me major Righteous Charge vibes, which was not good in its respective limited format. Giving Vigilance is nice, but sorcery speed pumps are really easy to play around and block effectively in combat. The good ones are usually only cards like Overrun because the Trample stops your opponent from being able to chump block profitably."}, "Bride's Gown": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This downside is too low for me to ever be actively trying to assemble the wedding finery combo. Marauder's Axe is just too bad of a card and the only way I could see myself playing both this and Groom's Finery is if I was a very aggressive Orzhov deck that had 1-2 of each. Even then, I could see it being incorrect to ever play this because you only want so many equipment in your deck."}, "Militia Rallier": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "My goodness, why does white get these stinkers? This is a worse Centaur Courser, which isn't even all that great nowadays. There's way better cards than this and I'd only play this if I had a bunch of human synergies to back it up with."}, "Unholy Officiant": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "It feels like every weak card nowadays is given Vigilance in an attempt to boost its power ever so slightly. This is way worse than Traveling Minister and feels like a way worse Anointed Chorister too, which was decent but rarely fantastic. There's better early plays than this that don't take a ton of mana before they're able to impact the board. I love how white is getting some vampires in this set though!"}, "Dawnhart Geist": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "A two mana 1/3 with little upside is near unplayable in modern day limited. Gaining two or four life off of this is fine and all, but even then that's nothing special. Don't be tricked into trying to get this to work, the payoff simply isn't there!"}, "Nebelgast Beguiler": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Armored Cancrix unfortunately is atrocious by today's standards. This being a tapper and a good blocker make it playable, but it's way too small for the cost for me to ever want to willingly play this."}, "Radiant Grace": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "The backside of this is fine, but the front side is atrocious. I wouldn't recommend playing this since it's so easy to get blown out by bounce or exile and have this not flip. Even when it does slip, only the most aggressive decks will be able to take full advantage of it."}, "Supernatural Rescue": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Really expensive, situational, and being easy to blow out makes this all risk and no reward. This doesn't even have Flash all the time, so that means that it'll often just be a way more expensive and clunky Abandon the Post, which saw little to no play in Midnight Hunt."}, "Hallowed Haunting": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "I want to give this a 0/5, but if you have like 12 enchantments then I suppose that this could be powerful. A super strange card that's meant for EDH and not for Limited play."}, "Sanctify": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "This is probably better than Disenchant in Limited because gaining three is quite relevant, but this should still only be a board card."}, "Olivia, Crimson Bride": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "The game is going to end almost immediately if Oliva isn't answered. She's difficult to block and is going to trigger nearly every turn, which doesn't seem particularly beatable. It's also nice that if the creature she brings back dies in combat, it'll just go to the graveyard and be able to get reanimated again next turn. Don't pass this and do everything you can to splash it if you see it later in the draft. Definitely a very sweet and cool card to represent the set."}, "Edgar, Charmed Groom": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "The man of the hour is looking as dapper as ever! Unkillable, and brutal on both sides is a fantastic combination and a near impossible card to beat."}, "Anje, Maid of Dishonor": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This has a sweet name and is near unbeatable when left unanswered, which means that you should never be passing it. Once you untap with Anje, you shouldn't have an issue draining the opponent out and quickly building up a bunch of Blood tokens to use as fodder. Oh yeah, Anje is also still a 4/5 that can deliver a serious beatdown all by herself."}, "Torens, Fist of the Angels": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Holy beans this is going to get out of hand insanely quickly if it lives. Toren will end up making a token almost every turn because of how creature dense limited decks are, and the tokens that Torens makes will get a counter on them after almost every combat. The tokens also help fuel one another since they can each get bigger and train one another. This is still a Gray Ogre, so it is fragile but I still don't see how you'll beat an opponent that sits back with this and quickly amasses an army of humans."}, "Halana and Alena, Partners": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "You do need another creature in play for for these two to do anything, but they impact the board almost immediately and quickly make each creature you control into a massive threat. Giving haste to the buffed creature means that following this up with a five drop should often come to close to ending the game on the spot."}, "Wandering Mind": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Sea Gate Oracle has never looked better (or creepier). This is a better Cloudkin Seer in my opinion, which is a great place to be. Every Izzet deck will want as many of these as possible and it will be one of the premium non-rare three drops of the entire set. Creatures that ETB and draw a card are just way too good!"}, "Skull Skaab": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Not netting off tokens being sacrificed stops this from being broken, but it's still great at fueling all the powerful Dimir Exploit payoffs. This isn't as good as Bladestitched Skaab, but I'm sure that it will still be a defining uncommon of the archetype."}, "Sigardian Paladin": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "With all the Training creatures in Selesnya, it shouldn't be hard to have targets for Sigardian Paladin\u2018s ability. Even if you don't have any counters when this enters, it's still a 4/4 for four which is more than fine in limited."}, "Runo Stromkirk": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "What an interesting card. The front side is fine but unexciting, and even though Runo is difficult to flip, it's really insane once it eventually does. Make sure to have a few six or seven drops to work with Runo, and just pray to get a blind flip or to tuck one back on top! Again, I love cards that are always fine and sometimes insane"}, "Old Rutstein": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This old creepy guy kind of reminds me of the mask salesman from Majora's Mask and Ocarina of Time! Talk about some all-star games. Old Rutstein is going to gain some serious value throughout the game, which makes me quite the fan of it. It's especially nice that it triggers when it enters, and it's also nice that because limited decks are packed with so many creatures, you'll have a decent chance at making a 1/1 every other upkeep. Just be weary not to mill out!"}, "Markov Purifier": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Dawn of Hope (kind of) on a decent body looks pretty great to me. It's nice that this triggers itself and works with a bunch of the various black and white commons too. Markov Purifier is a great defining uncommon for the archetype."}, "Eruth, Tormented Prophet": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "You need to be careful not to mill out once this is in play, but Phyrexian Arena on a decent blocker is well worth the risk in my opinion! I don't like how awkward this is when you exile more card draw with it, but other than that, Eruth seems like a phenomenal play once you have enough lands out."}, "Dorothea, Vengeful Victim": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "I like playing this and then usually not attacking until you can trade Dorothea, or deliver that last four points of damage. The Geist of Saint Traft enchantment on the back is very sweet though and should end the game very quickly. Also, who doesn't think of the Taylor Swift song \u201cDorothea\u201d whenever they read this?"}, "Bloodtithe Harvester": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Makes a Blood token, beats down early, and then is removal when the body gets outclassed? Talk about powerful, versatile, and a premium gold card for the Rakdos vampires strategy!"}, "Vilespawn Spider": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Spider Spawning this is not. Making 5+ 1/1 Insects is still good, but not nearly as backbreaking as an army of 1/2 Reach creatures. Four mana to activate is also a lot, but at least this triggers off itself being in the graveyard when you sacrifice it. This is still going to shine in the creature heavy Simic decks, but this isn't going to be a format powerhouse like Spider Spawning was."}, "Odric, Blood-Cursed": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Odric is honestly a lot worse than it seems. Most of the time he'll only be a Centaur Courser that makes 1-2 Blood tokens, which is far from broken. It pains me to say this, but vampire Odric is a lot less scary than his human version."}, "Markov Waltzer": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Heck yeah Boros finally has some vampires! This hits decently hard and does a good job at boosting your team, but it's not the best blocker and isn't that impressive unless you have multiple creatures out and also have profitable attacks available. This is solid, but not quite as good as some of the other gold cards we've seen."}, "Kaya, Geist Hunter": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Kaya only really shines once you have some tokens out, but at the very least she can always give your team deathtouch, which should make blocking very difficult for the opponent. Her ultimate is also great, though I still wouldn't expect Kaya to be the game dominating planeswalker that her Kaldheim variant was."}, "Grolnok, the Omnivore": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a really cool card, but I don't think it's all that powerful unfortunately. Getting in a profitable attack with a four mana 3/3 is going to often be difficult. However, the payoff is pretty decent when you do since you should draw 1-2 cards most of the time. Grolnok will obviously dominate an empty board incredibly quickly, but it's a shame that it's really going to underperform on an already clogged board."}, "Child of the Pack": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Accrues value quickly, and then flips and crushes the opponent. Seems like a top notch gold card to me!"}, "Brine Comber": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a really weird and hard to evaluate card. Both sides offer a bunch of 1/1's, so even with no auras this is probably fine. It seems hard to build around, but the floor here is still more than a good enough playable."}, "Ancient Lumberknot": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I mean this little Doran, the Siege Tower is a four mana 4/4 at worst, but I don't see it dominating board states unless you build your deck specifically around it. Still, this has a really high floor and will often add some power to your various creatures, so you'll always be looking to play it."}, "Mirrorhall Mimic": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This seems unbelievably powerful to me. At first it's clone, which is already solid, and then once it flips it turns into a Helm of Hosts aura. Never pass this because it really is that good, and hopefully you have some removal ready for when your opponent Disturbs this, otherwise the game will end in turn or two."}, "Jacob Hauken, Inspector": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "An early looter that eventually transforms and takes over the game seems pretty darn great to me. Take it and do everything that you can to play it!"}, "Hullbreaker Horror": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This is really expensive, but it should catch you up as soon as it hits play because it'll easily gobble up your opponent's best attacker. Once you untap with this, it basically becomes impossible to kill because you can Unsubstantiate itself or whatever removal that is targeting it. This seems incredibly difficult to answer and beat, which makes it a bomb in my book!"}, "Overcharged Amalgam": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "A beefy flash flier is already great because of how easy it is to ambush a creature in combat. Getting to trade a trash creature for an opponent's valuable spell pushes this over the edge and makes it incredibly backbreaking in way too many situations."}, "Necroduality": {"Rate": "4*", "Desc": "This is awful if you're lacking zombies, and absolutely busted if your deck consists of mostly zombies. The game will probably just end once you copy your second zombie, so I recommend taking this early, building around it, and making your opponent concede by turn six because you popped off so hard with it."}, "Geralf, Visionary Stitcher": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This is a great blocker that stops removal from working against your other creatures, upgrades mediocre ground creatures, and makes combat incredibly difficult for the opponent since you can chump and turn whatever you're blocking with into a zombie. It's awkward that your zombies lose Flying once Geralf dies, but the fact that it gives all your zombies flying means that you might even be able to crush the opponent in combat as soon as this hits play! Four toughness is also a lot, so I bet that this will be able to dodge a lot of the red and green removal in the format."}, "Cemetery Illuminator": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "A consistent source of graveyard management and card advantage on an already above rate flier looks fantastic to me. Every deck wants this and there's not a common or uncommon that you should be taking over this."}, "Witness the Future": {"Rate": "3.5*", "Desc": "This is giving me major Clear the Mind vibes since it's impossible to mill out if you have two of these in your draft deck. The super controlling decks that want this effect will almost certainly be able to abuse it since you're still getting an Impulse while also ensuring that you still have enough juice in your deck to answer every threat that your opponent throws at you. Don't play this unless you're a very specific deck, but if you are that type of deck then you're gonna kill for a copy or two of this."}, "Thirst for Discovery": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Another fantastic draw spell right here. Compulsive Research was already amazing in draft, and this being an instant for practically no downside makes it much better. It's gonna feel so good to peel this in the late game and be nearly guaranteed to hit two or more spells off of it."}, "Stormchaser Drake": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Holy smokes this is an incredible two drop! Welkin Tern is already solid, but if you build around this you could chain off pretty easily. I can't wait to build around this beauty in draft!"}, "Patchwork Crawler": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "I love two drops that scale well into the late game. It's not great that this can only target your graveyard, but this is going to get out of hand quickly after you've been trading all game and then start activating it after you've used all the spells in your hand."}, "Inspired Idea": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "At five mana this is still fine, and at three in the late game it's phenomenal. It's not too difficult to empty your hand in limited, and it's really important to have cards like this in order to prevent flood from costing you the game. I'd play this in any deck and foresee it being a top-notch late game play."}, "Dreamshackle Geist": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is backbreaking when you're the aggressor, and still solid when you're behind and trying to manage your opponents board. Another rare that I rarely see myself passing."}, "Wretched Throng": {"Rate": "3*", "Desc": "If you have multiples of these then you pretty much get to Exploit for free, which could be very valuable. I wouldn't go out of my way to take this early, but if you see a bunch wheeling then I say go in and try to live the dream of getting five and having them be your only two drops."}, "Whispering Wizard": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Murmuring Mystic this is not because of how much worse a 3/2 is than a 1/5 with this effect. Triggering once a turn isn't the biggest drawback though since you can just cast a spell on your turn and wait to cast your instants on the opponent's turn. When built around this will take over the game pretty quickly, so even if the body is fragile, the risk is well worth the reward here."}, "Screaming Swarm": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I could be overvaluing this slightly, but I really like how difficult it is to kill and how it can end a game out of nowhere in the super late game. This does have the issue of unintentionally fueling the opponent's graveyard synergies though, which isn't the best."}, "Scattered Thoughts": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I love Tamiyo's Epiphany in limited, and this is way, way better that that because it's an instant.

It's also really powerful because you can easily run away with a game after playing this on turn two and following it up with some creature removal. Getting a Curiosity once this Disturbs will also end up being solid with all the great fliers in blue. Another great Disturb card that you should always be playing."}, "Lunar Rejection": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "At worst you get a four mana Repulse, and getting this effect for two mana against your green/red opponent is going to feel dirty. Another card that I never see cutting because of it's high floor and ceiling."}, "Lantern Bearer": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I absolutely love this design. This pecks in early and then turns into an Arcane Flight later on in the game and helps you keep the pressure up. This also works well with Exploit, which makes me think that most decks are going to want as many Lantern Bearers as possible."}, "Gutter Skulker": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a great attacker, and if it does trade it guarantees that the biggest creature on the board will be able to keep up the intense pressure that this puts down. I'd always play this."}, "Diver Skaab": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Now this is a great top end play for your blue decks! Assuming that you aren't exploiting a valuable creature, then a five mana 3/5 with an Aether Gust attached is going to be fantastic! I'm still low on taking five drops early, but I might make an exception here."}, "Cruel Witness": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I love Phantom Monster in limited, and Cruel Witness is no exception. Getting to Surveil whenever you cast a spell is just the icing on the cake, and I don't see myself ever cutting this from my blue decks."}, "Cobbled Lancer": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "It should be easy to double spell with this and something else later in the game, which will lead to some back-breaking turns. Being great to trade off or mill pushes this over the edge and makes me happy to play Cobbled Lancer in any blue deck with over 10 creatures."}, "Chill of the Grave": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "My goodness this is significantly better than Neonate's Rush. Crippling Chill was always good, but it becomes so much better at two mana. It shouldn't be too hard to have a zombie out if you're blue, which makes me think that nearly every blue deck will be happy playing multiple copies of this."}, "Biolume Egg": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This seems fantastic to me!

This fulfills both of those rolls, and makes me think that it will be a pretty good two drop in the blue decks that aren't hyper aggressive."}, "Repository Skaab": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I love Ardent Elementalist, but having to give up a creature to get the effect is a little costly in my book. Getting a bigger body out of the deal is solid, which makes me think that this will be awkward some of the time but mostly a decent playable for the spell heavy blue decks."}, "Binding Geist": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This attacks surprisingly well since it can shrink down whatever cheap creature or token that would normally trade up with this. The Disturb side is mediocre, but this works well with Exploit and is something that most decks will play but not be insanely excited with."}, "Skywarp Skaab": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "The body here is fine for the cost, and this becomes quite good once you're able to draw a card off of it.

Nothing too special, but a fine five drop right here."}, "Dreadlight Monstrosity": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This is a decent finisher that shouldn't have much issue with quickly ending the game after it's cast. It's expensive so you don't want much of this sort of effect, but it'll often end up being pretty good in most of your blue decks."}, "Cradle of Safety": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Starlit Mantle is back baby! I went 2-0 in the World's draft potion with two of those beauties in my Theros Beyond Death draft deck. Unfortunately, Crimson Vow doesn't have Constellation to make this a truly great trick, but it does still synergize well with some of the enchantment matters cards in white.

Sometimes you'll play this, but I doubt it will ever perform particularly well. "}, "Steelclad Spirit": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This is a way worse Prismari Pledgemage because of how hard it is to get this to attack. Slow decks might want this and maybe you'll board this in against aggressive decks, but for the most part I would try to avoid a card that isn't particularly good at any point in the game."}, "Geistlight Snare": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "A three mana Mana Leak is pretty bad, so I wouldn't look to play this unless I had a decent number of Spirits and Enchantments. This is often going to be a worse Cancel, so I wouldn't bother wasting an early pick on it. The few decks that do want this effect shouldn't have a hard time wheeling it."}, "Fear of Death": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This seems like an okay removal in a deck that's looking to be controlling, which blue looks like it will excel in. Not to mention that blue has some great fliers and Disturb cards that synergize well with this, which makes me believe that most slower decks that meet those considerations will be somewhat interested in some copies of this. The only issue is that Exploit is in the format, which makes aura removal way worse. It actually makes it so much worse that the value of this plummets in this format and it's a card that I would be incredibly reluctant to play out of the fear of getting blown out."}, "Serpentine Ambush": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "I really hate mediocre two mana combat tricks, and that is exactly what this is. I would never play this unless I was low on playables."}, "Consuming Tide": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "Consuming Tide being symmetrical means that it's going to be very difficult to get your opponent with this while also not incinerating any tempo that you were trying to gain. Not even being guaranteed to draw a card makes this even more awkward. Again, another Commander card that limited players should steer clear of, unless you're specifically a control deck with an incredibly low amount of nonland permanents in it."}, "Foreboding Statue": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Every deck will want this, since once you've used it for mana early on you can start to beat down with a three mana 5/5. I'm very excited to play a ton with this card!"}, "Dollhouse of Horrors": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is slow, but it's going to take over the game pretty quickly assuming that you have 15+ creatures in your deck. I'd play this in just about every deck that meets that creature count. The tokens getting Haste is scary from both a gameplay and flavor perspective. Crazy Stuffy Dolls running around trying to kill the opponent just has to give you the creeps!"}, "Investigator's Journal": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "You'll need a few creatures in play before you can play this and be happy, but that doesn't seem particularly difficult. This feels similarly powerful to how Mazemind Tome was in limited, which means that every deck will happily play this. However, it's still not going to be as good as the top uncommons and good removal."}, "Wedding Invitation": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "There just isn't the room to jam this mediocre filler into your limited decks. You want all your cards to do something, and for two mana this accomplishes incredibly little. Even if I had a ton of Vampires in my deck I wouldn't be taking this highly, though I probably would still consider playing a copy because giving an unblockable creature lifelink could help change the tide of a race."}, "Honored Heirloom": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Manalith has simply not withstood the test of time. If you face an opponent with a ton of graveyard synergies, then this might do something, but even then it's way too clunky for my tastes."}, "Blood Servitor": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Gray Ogre is not where you want to be, even if your deck is blood hungry. Don't play this unless you're forced to."}, "Lantern of the Lost": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "This is a nice little piece of graveyard hate that is a lot better than Soul-Guide Lantern was in Theros Beyond Death.

Just play anything over this, please."}, "Boarded Window": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "Talk about having the best darn flavor in the whole set!

Once this does flip, your opponent maybe has a turn or two before they'll be overrun with bats, which makes this a bomb rare in my book."}, "Toxrill, the Corrosive": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "Now this doesn't seem remotely beatable if it lives for a turn. It's huge, continually Contagion Engine's your opponent's creatures, and also makes a horde of slugs. The sacrifice effect honestly doesn't really matter, so don't even bother trying to splash it's effect if you're not blue. Take this, play it, and get a little taste of what it was like to Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite your opponent in 2011."}, "Sorin the Mirthless": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "As expected, Sorin is a stone cold killer in limited. It draws cards, protects itself with powerful fliers, and kills the opponent when it ultimates. This is good on every board state and I would never pass this at any point during a draft."}, "Henrika Domnathi": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "What a sweet name and sweet card. Obviously this is a bomb that'll get you a ton of value and then flip into a huge threat that should easily end the game."}, "Dreadfeast Demon": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "It's hard for seven drops to be all-stars considering how fast modern day limited is, but I think that Dreadfeast Demon more than makes up for it's clunkiness with it's powerful effect. This will quickly turn your entire board into unbeatable demons, and unless your opponent has instant speed removal for this, then it'll duplicate the first time and leave them with no way to answer both copies of it. Don't pass this and hope that you have a Valorous Stance or something at the ready if your opponent casts it!"}, "Cemetery Desecrator": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This is a huge Flametongue Kavu on it's way in and out of play, which is always going to be an all-star in any limited format."}, "Bloodvial Purveyor": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This is enormous, and if your opponent doesn't have removal for it then they're not going to last long. This is definitely one of the better rares in the set for Limited!"}, "Hero's Downfall": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "You just can't beat a murder with upside when it comes to Limited. I love reprinting this at uncommon and it even has great flavor. Talking about the downfall of Odric in the flavor text is really cool!"}, "Headless Rider": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Combat seems impossible once this is in play considering the abundance of zombies in the set. Your opponent better have some exile removal otherwise I don't see how they would efficiently answer this."}, "Skulking Killer": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Now this seems like a really fun card to try to get to work. When it does, it's going to be insanely good like versions of this from the past (Bleeding Edge is the first one that comes to mind for me). Worst case scenario, this is still a four mana 4/2 when you really need to make a play, which is pretty bad but is also not embarrassing. Not to mention that if you play this and clear the board then you shouldn't have too much of an issue with starting to connect with this Giant Cockroach!"}, "Restless Bloodseeker": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This will make so much Blood, and then it flips pretty easily in most black decks. This is powerful once it does flip seeing how it drains for relatively cheap and continues making more Blood token. This and Gluttonous Guest seem like a match made in heaven!"}, "Path of Peril": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This grade is assuming that you can cast it for its Cleave cost. Six mana is unfortunately a lot for a wrath, but it's nice that this can still be used early on to handle an opponent's quick start or answer a horde of tokens. I'd definitely plan to board this unless you're Orzhov or a really slow, creature-light black deck."}, "Parasitic Grasp": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "An Essence Drain that's sometimes only two mana is a fantastic removal spell and way to keep up. Obviously you should always be playing this."}, "Fell Stinger": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "A 3/2 Deathtouch for three is already solid, but this is way better than that because it lets you turn a useless creature into some serious value later in the game. Plus if you're land screwed and need to get out of it as soon as possible, then just use this as a Blood Pact! Also keep in mind that this has the added benefit of being able to deal the last two points of damage to an unsuspecting opponent."}, "Falkenrath Forebear": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is near impossible to answer profitably with removal unless you exile it. It beats down, fuels itself, and seems like a major headache to have to deal with. So many cards make Blood tokens, so even if this dies before connecting you'll still probably be able to bring it back!"}, "Concealing Curtains": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This blocks nicely early on, and then turns into a solid creature with a Vendilion Clique ability tacked on, which is good at answering your opponents bombs and key removal. This is great and a must-include in any black deck. "}, "Bleed Dry": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is a very good removal spell that no black deck is ever going to cut. It exiling is a nice little boost now that's for sure!"}, "Wedding Security": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a very powerful Blood payoff that's going to quickly end the game. Assuming you have ample Blood producers, then I would happily play as many copies of this as I could get my hands on."}, "Ragged Recluse": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This depends entirely on how many discard outlets you have, but that shouldn't be too hard to accomplish with all the Blood tokens in the format. If you do have enough ways to flip this, then it's a potent threat that can easily swing a race. I foresee this flipping often and early on, which makes me think that it's going to be a stellar two drop."}, "Gluttonous Guest": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Blood tokens are an interesting design, but honestly don't seem all that powerful to me unless you combine them with payoffs like this. Looting is fine in limited, but because of how much faster and less forgiving modern formats are, it's common to not have enough time to be spending mana on something that does not affect the board.Still, a three mana 1/4 that gains a few life and gives you a late game loot is going to be pretty decent, especially in the slow and more controlling sort of decks. Black's game plan seems to favor cards like Gluttonous Guest being part of it."}, "Gift of Fangs": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Heck yeah, Bonds of Faith for Vampires is so cool! This is obviously a great early removal spell since it'll kill most small things like Dead Weight normally does, and then in the late game you can put this on some flying vampire and try to go the distance with it."}, "Courier Bat": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Now this is an incredibly powerful card in the right deck. A Flying Gravedigger for three mana is insanely ahead of the curve, and even when you don't trigger it you're still left with a Wind Drake. I love this card and plan to take it highly and build around it."}, "Catapult Fodder": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I love this design and think that it's surprisingly powerful. A 1/5 will hold down the fort long enough for you to flip this, and once you do you'll be able to fling your high toughness creatures and quickly end the game. I can only imagine how brutal it will be when you fling an Unhallowed Phalanx!"}, "Undying Malice": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Now this is my kind of combat trick. It's incredibly situational and most likely a little worse than Supernatural Stamina since it's difficult to have everything go right and have your creature trade after casting this. I love how this retriggers ETB's, protects from removal, and is amazing with Exploit. I usually don't love situational combat tricks, but I'm a big fan of this in creature heavy decks and as a potent board card."}, "Undead Butler": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I like that this fuels graveyard synergies while also being a fantastic creature to Exploit. Keep in mind that Novice Occultist-like creatures like these are going to be especially good in Crimson Vow."}, "Innocent Traveler": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Sweet flavor and an overall decent card right here. I'd prefer a Phantom Monster since your opponent does have a lot of options with this card and ways to make it not flip, which can be awkward. However, the backside is powerful and will often be triggered, which makes me like this creepy traveler and not seeing myself cutting it often."}, "Grisly Ritual": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "The black removal in this set is looking solid like it was in Midnight Hunt. You get a lot of value out of this, and in conjunction with all the Blood hungry Vampires I really like this even though it is a little clunky."}, "Doomed Dissenter": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I love this card, and I'm especially happy to see it back in a format with Exploit. This is a solid enabler that also buys you a lot of time in the early game, which makes it a two drop that I'm quite fond of."}, "Desperate Farmer": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Assuming you can consistently flip this, you're getting a solid deal. The front side is anemic, but I like this enough that I think that it'll perform well in a lot of the creature heavy black decks that have a bunch of Exploit. This kind of just seems like a better Thraben Sentry to me, which I'm all for."}, "Bloodsworn Squire": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This is worse than it looks, even though giving itself Indestructible is powerful and the backside is so flashy. Having four creatures in the yard is asking a lot, and this is a little expensive to activate when it isn't flipped, so while I would often play this I wouldn't recommend taking it early."}, "Bloodcrazed Socialite": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This a decent four drop that will especially shine in an aggressive deck that's producing a lot of Blood tokens. This isn't spectacular, but I'm sure that a lot of decks will happily play this."}, "Aim for the Head": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I love me a Mind Rot, especially when it exiles in a format full of Disturb. Exiling a zombie should also come up often enough, which will make this a decent card to main deck and a premium board card."}, "Rot-Tide Gargantua": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "I love Predatory Nightstalker so much, but I doubt that this gargantua will be able to live up to the legacy of that limited all-star. Having to Exploit to get the edict makes it so you're not getting a two-for-one out of this, which means that you're paying for a big body that's weak to removal. Five drops that are soft to removal and don't have a relevant impact on the board are rarely worth playing unfortunately.Think about Diregraf Horde for Midnight Hunt and why it was so good. It fueled all your Decay synergies like Siege Zombie, shut down the opponent's graveyard synergies, and also was excellent against spot removal. Rot-Tide is none of those, so while I wouldn't be embarrassed to play this, I would rarely be seeking it out."}, "Persistent Specimen": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "I honestly love Sanitarium Skeleton, and in my opinion, this is a better version of it. I love how well that this combos with Exploit, and I can imagine that most of the black decks of the format will be interested in a copy or two of this."}, "Mindleech Ghoul": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "How good Exploit is is going to depend almost entirely on how well your deck can abuse it as well as what type of deck your opponent has. Most of the time this is just going to be a two mana 2/2, but it is nice that in the late game when this gets outclassed you can try to snag your opponents last powerful spell that they've been sandbagging.Keep in mind that the existence of this card is going to encourage players to hold a land or two in their hand in order to protect their important spells from being discarded when they're playing against a black deck."}, "Diregraf Scavenger": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Decent four drops are way too common in limited, so while these are decent stats, it's nothing particularly special.

A lot of creature heavy decks will be interested in one of these, especially if they have multiple ways to get value off of the Blood token.

If you have a bunch of discard outlets that can benefit from this, then I say go for it but otherwise I would avoid situational, clunky spells like this."}, "Dread Fugue": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This is usually going to just be a Coercion, but that affect is often going to be a solid board option. Most of the cards that you're interested in taking cost more than two mana, not to mention that the odds of missing are way too high if you cast this on turn one, so I'd avoid main decking this and only bring it in when you face a crazy bomb."}, "Pointed Discussion": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "I really hate Divinations that lose you life.

Even the best case scenario of exiling some garbage and finding your best card isn't great because you had to waste three mana in order to do it, which will often lead to you falling too far behind.

This is obviously great and I would always play it, but I do wish that it could do more on clogged board states."}, "Olivia's Attendants": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This is one of those \u201ckill it quickly or you lose\u201d sort of rares. It's nice that this can be answered and the game can resume, but if it isn't, it should easily dominate the board and quickly get to work on the opponent's life total. At least it costs six mana and takes awhile to take over the game!"}, "Ill-Tempered Loner": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Combat becomes impossible once this flips, and even if it never does, this is a must-block creature that will often trade for two creatures or just straight up kill the opponent. The backside is so good that I would rarely ever pass this."}, "Voltaic Visionary": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is a stellar two drop. Sure, you have to deal yourself two to flip it, but you get to draw a card and get a huge beater once you pay that price. Every deck will want this because of how powerful it is at nearly every point in the game. Don't be afraid to burn yourself a little if it means you're getting this much value!"}, "Stensia Uprising": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Getting a 1/1 every turn is more than good enough to see play, and the fact that this ends the game rather quickly with the deal seven makes it an even scarier threat. It shouldn't be too difficult to get to thirteen permanents when you're looking to crack this and end the game. Any card that provides a consistent advantage over the course of the game will often be especially powerful in limited because games tend to go so long. That's why planeswalkers are so good and that's why I believe that this will be great."}, "Rending Flame": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is mostly just Soul Sear, which is normally just an easier to cast Murder. I'll always play as much removal as I can get my hands on, and Rending Flame is no exception. Getting to deal two is just gravy, but when that does happen it's going to be particularly disgusting. Though with all of the Disturb in the format I bet that this will be dealing two surprisingly often!"}, "Magma Pummeler": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This seems like a nightmare to slog through in combat. A huge Magma Pummeler will end the game quickly, and even if it's only for two or three, it should be able to hold down the ground nicely. Keep in mind that this can even attack and block creatures with Deathtouch profitably!"}, "Honeymoon Hearse": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This gives me major Renegade Freighter vibes, which worries me a bit. A three mana 5/5 Trampler is enormous, and tapping two creatures to crew it seems very doable. You'll need a very high creature count to make the best use of this, but it seems tough to beat this on turn three after your opponent follows it up with a few creatures."}, "Dominating Vampire": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Now this is quite the aggressive creature. The floor of being a three mana 3/3 is already more than acceptable in limited, and when you get a free Claim the First Born or Threaten out of this, it's going to be back breaking. A solid card and definitely something I would try to build around if I got it early enough."}, "Curse of Hospitality": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Red has a bunch of aggressive creatures and great ways to push them through, especially with the help of the Trample that this is providing. A three mana Coastal Piracy that helps trigger itself seems great to me, so you better hope that you're not behind when your opponent casts this."}, "Creepy Puppeteer": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "What a weird card. A four mana 4/3 Haste is above rate for Limited though, and being able to buff up a smaller attacking creature means that this should deliver a serious beat down the turn it comes down. This is solid, but far from a bomb rare."}, "Chandra, Dressed to Kill": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is an absolute nightmare to beat if it comes down on turn three. It ramps, draws cards, and quickly works it's way up to the ultimate, which should win the game assuming you have a spell lying around or hit one in the top five. Obviously she works the best in primarily red decks, but I'd happily play her no matter what. The reason she's not higher though is because she doesn't protect herself and doesn't do much when you're behind or facing down a few fliers."}, "Cemetery Gatekeeper": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Things are going to get ugly quickly if you exile a creature with this and your opponent doesn't have an answer. A 2/1 First Strike for two is already solid, and once this starts to deal 2-6 damage it'll become amazing. This is a great card that I would probably only take the absolutely best uncommons and premium removal over."}, "Alluring Suitor": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "It seems incredibly easy to flip Alluring Suitor and insanely difficult to block it after it flips. I might be overrating this slightly, but curving a two drop into this and then casting multiple spells on turn four seems like a near impossible start to beat. I'm very excited to try this out and see if it performs as well as I'm expecting it to!"}, "Abrade": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Two mana deal 3's will always be great in limited, and Abrade is no exception. This is pretty much the same as Cathartic Pyre, but maybe you'll get the sweet satisfaction of blowing up a Dollhouse of Horrors with this!"}, "Vampires' Vengeance": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This of course gets better or worse depending on the density of vampires in your deck. This is going to be pretty nuts though when you're playing Rakdos and cast it post combat, killing three of your opponents creatures and none of your own while also getting a Blood token. Even if your red deck is low on vampires and high on low-toughness creatures, this will still be a great board option."}, "Sanguine Statuette": {"Rate": "3*", "Desc": "This mostly seems like a mediocre attacker and blocker unless your deck is filled to the brim with Blood producers and users. Almost no decks will want this, but the few Rakdos vampire decks that do will most likely be able to make good use of it."}, "Runebound Wolf": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a fantastic payoff for werewolf decks and a great playable in any red deck. I love how this can beat down early and then deliver the last few points of burn in the late game after the board gets clogged up. This is a very solid two drop and a big reason to look to go Gruul werewolves."}, "Markov Retribution": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This will dominate a lot of board states assuming that you have the 8+ vampires needed to make sure this is consistently turned on. I know that I'm going to obliterate my opponent  in combat a large percentage of the time that I cast this!"}, "Kessig Wolfrider": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This pecks in for a few points early on and then starts cranking out a 3/2 or two? Sign me up, this is good at every point of the game and is a card that I never plan on cutting from my red decks."}, "Flame-Blessed Bolt": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "You can never go wrong with playing as many Magma Spray as possible. Cheap removal will without fail always be a solid pick and great in limited."}, "Bloody Betrayal": {"Rate": "3*", "Desc": "Now this has gotten way better with Exploit in the format. I really hope that Rakdos sacrifice is a thing in this set, and even if it isn't, there will be decks that can make good use of this sort of effect. Obviously if you're controlling or don't have good synergies with this, then don't play it."}, "Blood Hypnotist": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is incredibly powerful in the Rakdos vampires decks. There's a ton of great Blood token producers, which means that it shouldn't be too difficult to start cracking them whenever is convenient and start crashing in for a ton of damage. This not being able to block does mean that only the aggressively leaning decks will be interested in this though."}, "Reckless Impulse": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "If you have a low curve and are planning to be aggressive, then this should perform well. Keep your curve in mind when playing this because the last thing you want is to play it and only be able to hit one spell off of it."}, "Lightning Wolf": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Nothing too flashy here, but this is a fine attacker and blocker that even works well with the random wolf/werewolf synergies in the set!"}, "Lambholt Raconteur": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This fits nicely in the Izzet spells deck because of how quickly it will end the game after flipping. I love the play pattern of this and how good it will feel to pass, flip this, and then start casting a bunch of instants and shocking the opponent to death."}, "Lacerate Flesh": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "A five mana deal four is a little clunky and awkward when it's a sorcery, but at least you get paid off for sending a lot of mana to kill a small creature. This is an okay removal spell, but I can imagine it disappointing often when I'm not able to kill the threat or bomb that's dominating the game"}, "Hungry Ridgewolf": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This is a pretty decent early beater in pretty much every Red deck. It shouldn't be difficult to get a couple of these and some werewolves in your deck, at which point this should be consistently powered up. Two drops are the most important part of aggressive decks, and I see this being a key curve filler in the format."}, "Frenzied Devils": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "For the most part, this seems like a worse Storm Skreelix since it's easy to chump. However, the Skreelix was always solid in the Izzet spell decks, and I assume that the same will be true for Frenzied Devils. I also foresee people struggling to play against this because of how hard it is to know when to block this or not. The Haste is a little strange here considering that you won't often attack with this the turn that it comes in because you won't have the mana to cast spells and buff this."}, "Falkenrath Celebrants": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This is some decent top end for the red aggressive decks that will help to fuel your other vampires with all the blood it creates. This isn't an all-star five drop like Diregraf Horde, but it's still quite good and something that I would be happy to top my curve with."}, "Blood Petal Celebrant": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "A nice little aggressive threat that nets you a Blood token when it dies is going to be plenty good in most decks. It's nice to see that so far, Red has a nice amount of good common two drops to fill their curve with."}, "Ballista Watcher": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Pingers are very powerful in Limited because they basically invalidate every one toughness creature your opponent has once they untap. This is expensive to activate, but that seems fine because it's still a decent attacker on both sides. Nothing amazing, but definitely a solid four drop right here."}, "Alchemist's Gambit": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I love me a Time Walk in Limited, but seven sure is a hefty price to pay for it. Not getting birds like Alrund's Epiphany makes this way worse than it seems at first glance. This is still fine and I'll almost always play it if I'm Izzet, but I would never bank on casting this for three mana so don't play it unless you're Izzet. "}, "Pyre Spawn": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Dang, red actually has some decent top end for once it seems. This is awkward if it's bounced or exiled, but for the most part this should be similarly powerful to Pitchburn Devils from original Innistrad. I like the idea of topping a lot of my decks with this. Do keep in mind that the abundance of decent late game in red means that you should rarely be prioritizing these sorts of cards."}, "Kessig Flamebreather": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This will be fine in the Izzet spells deck and basically unplayable everywhere else. Even in Izzet this will only be okay, so don't get duped into overvaluing this by thinking about the best case scenarios of playing this on turn two and unleashing a flurry of spells."}, "Fearful Villager": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "I love early creatures with Menace, though it's a lot better when they're a 3/2 instead of a 2/3. This feels very similar (though slightly better) than Harvesttide Infiltrator, which was a decent curve filler but only really shined when played with a bunch of wolf/werewolf payoffs. I'd play Fearful Villager in most aggressive decks, but it'll probably only perform slightly better than Brimstone Vandal, which is kind of disappointing."}, "Daybreak Combatants": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This will be fine filler in the very aggressive decks and pretty poor everywhere else. A Gray Ogre is just so bad, even if they do have Haste and an okay ETB. Creatures are way too big nowadays for you to be able to play a three mana 2/2 and be able to keep up."}, "Weary Prisoner": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This feels almost identical to Tavern Ruffian, except it's slightly worse. This is a good blocker that does transform into a powerful threat, but you can do better for four mana in this set. I'd probably still play this if you have the werewolf synergies to back it up and bench it if you don't."}, "Voldaren Epicure": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "Now this is a weird one to evaluate. This provides a decent amount for one mana, but at the end of a day a one mana vanilla 1/1 is rarely going to do much. Maybe if you have a ton of Blood users or are mono red I would include this, but for the most part this seems way too low impact for my liking."}, "Sure Strike": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "A classic mediocre, yet still serviceable combat trick right here. It'll get the job done, but not efficiently. It never blows you away, but it's always there for you when you need it. I love me a trusty Sure Strike and I'm looking forward to begrudgingly including it in my aggressive decks that are lacking removal."}, "Belligerent Guest": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "A 3/2 for three just doesn't cut it anymore. This is rarely going to connect and will often trade down, so I'd rather fill out my curve with something else."}, "End the Festivities": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "A nice board option that cleanly answers something busted like a Voldaren Bloodcaster. Keep this in the sideboard and wait to bring it in after seeing crazy powerful one toughness creatures like that."}, "Ancestral Anger": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "This is cool and has great flavor, but it ultimately is too low impact for it to interest me in limited. The only place I could see wanting this is a 14 land mono red deck that has like 5-6 of these."}, "Into the Night": {"Rate": "0.0", "Desc": "How many discard/draw effects are in this set? They're all awful, so please don't play them. Making it night for four mana and doing some rummaging is way too expensive and anemic. You have to impact the board in some way when you're spending that much mana."}, "Change of Fortune": {"Rate": "0.0", "Desc": "Please don't waste four mana to cast this nonsense. I can't think of a single way to abuse this in limited, which often means that it's effect is probably just worse than drawing a singular card."}, "Avabruck Caretaker": {"Rate": "5.0", "Desc": "Yikes, now this is basically unbeatable. Well, at least it's a mythic and hopefully my opponent's won't play it often and instead I'll be the one riding it to victory! Also, this is probably the best limited card in the entire set with Faithbound Judge being its only competition."}, "Ulvenwald Oddity": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "Talk about an insane rate and a ton of power and abilities for not much mana. If this flips and isn't answered, the game should end on the spot."}, "Hiveheart Shaman": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "I doubt that this will often find a land when it attacks if you're playing a two color deck, but that doesn't matter. What I'm interested in is paying six to keep making 3/3 or 4/4 insects! Hiveheart Shaman will block early and then steadily take over the game if it isn't answered, which makes it a great rare in my book."}, "Glorious Sunrise": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This reminds me of when Gandalf saved the day in The Two Towers Lord of the Rings movie. Just like how he came with the sunrise and crushed the enemy, Glorious Sunrise will do the same. This gets way better if you already have creatures out, but even if you don't, gaining three every turn or adding a bunch of mana will help you quickly catch up. This is a bomb in every green deck and should be taken over any common or uncommon."}, "Cemetery Prowler": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This isn't a bomb or anything, but it is a great way to manage the opponent's graveyard while also making your spells cheaper, which is very powerful. The tide of a game often turns once a player starts double spelling consistently, and Cemetery Prowler helps facilitate that."}, "Ascendant Packleader": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This is great on turn one and turn eight, which is quite the rarity for a one drop creature. If you play this early, it beats in and gets big quickly as you start to curve out, and if you play this later on it's likely to come in as a 3/2 that will still incidentally get counters as the game drags on. This is brutally efficient at nearly every point in the game, and I expect to lose to this on turn one way too often."}, "Wolf Strike": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "I like how you can pass, bring it to night, and then use this to take down a big creature. This isn't Clear Shot, but it's still a good removal spell that I'm happy to include in all my green decks. Green is very low on removal in this set, so I would value this especially highly."}, "Wolfkin Outcast": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This kicks major butt if you can get it down for four mana seeing as it's bound to dominate combat once it flips. This will be one of those cards that the werewolf heavy decks will be gunning for, and most other players will steer clear of. It's so good in the werewolf decks that I'm going to shoot high with this rating."}, "Reclusive Taxidermist": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Poor Werebear couldn't keep up with the times. Still, this is a phenomenal two drop in any green deck and something that everyone is going to try to get their hands on."}, "Packsong Pup": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "What an adorable little dude! Top notch flavor here and a solid playable in most green decks. It shouldn't be difficult to have 5+ werewolves/wolves in your green decks, which at that point this is going to get big quickly. I foresee some brutal starts off the back of this little pup on turn two and then being followed up with by a werewolf the next turn."}, "Infestation Expert": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Holy moly, now this is a fantastic five drop. You get a bunch of value off this as soon as it enters, and once this does flip your opponent should die after you've gotten one or two attacks in with this. Super cool card and probably the best non-rare five drop in the set."}, "Howling Moon": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is more or less a one-sided Rule of Law that makes attacking with your wolves and werewolves incredibly enticing. Assuming you have a critical mass of furry friends, then this should be solid and a nightmare for an opponent who's slightly behind to handle."}, "Howlpack Piper": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "It's tough because the front side of this is pretty weak, but the backside is fantastic. Being able to cheat out some big werewolves and then easily flip this is pretty valuable though, which makes me think that this should perform well in every green deck."}, "Hamlet Vanguard": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "It shouldn't be too difficult for this to enter as at least a 3/3 with Ward two, and when this is built around you can probably get this to a 5/5 or 7/7 with relative ease. Again, this is really going to shine in Selesnya, so don't feel obligated to play this in any green deck because it's going to underperform if you don't have a high density of humans in your deck."}, "Cultivator Colossus": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "A huge Trampler that sometimes draws a card or two is well worth the cost in my book. By the time you hit your 7th land I doubt that you'll be able to trigger this all that consistently, but even if you don't you're gonna be getting a 7/7+ Trampler for seven mana, which is still a pretty good deal."}, "Weaver of Blossoms": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Both sides of this are solid, and I see Weaver of Blossoms being a key part of the green ramp strategies and Gruul werewolf decks. Your mana really does explode when this flips, and I love how well it's is able to cast an instant after it does flip."}, "Spore Crawler": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a nice bread-and-butter three drop that almost any deck will be interested in. Exploiting this for value will also be nice and makes this a lot more versatile than it might seem at first glance."}, "Spiked Ripsaw": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Plate Armor that makes blocking a nightmare in the late game seems like a very powerful equipment to me. Being clunky is the only drawback here, but turning any creature into a huge threat should be worth the cost."}, "Sawblade Slinger": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Sawblade Slinger is incredibly situational, but when it works it's going to be amazing. Yet again, I love playing cards with a high floor and ceiling, which makes me want to play cards exactly like Sawblade Slinger. Feel free to board it out if it doesn't have targets though!"}, "Rural Recruit": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This offers two decent bodies that pair incredibly well together. It's near impossible to answer this profitably, and it adds so much power to the board, especially once it starts attacking and Training itself. This is a premier common creature and a four drop you'll want to play as many copies of as possible."}, "Oakshade Stalker": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "You'll usually play this as a Centaur Courser, but having the option to flash it in will come up and the backside has a ton of power and should be a nightmare in combat if it gets Trample from something like a Spiked Ripsaw or Massive Might."}, "Laid to Rest": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Wow, human tribal is getting a ton of limited support! This is yet another card that Selesnya will want to prioritize because once it hits play, combat will become a nightmare for your opponent. I like cards like this because so few decks can use an effect like this, so the decks that want this shouldn't have an issue wheeling something like this."}, "Hookhand Mariner": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I love a four mana 4/4, and this is way better than that. I'd never cut this and hope to use it as the backbone beater of most of my green decks."}, "Dormant Grove": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I can't imagine wanting to flip this often, but it's nice that you'll get the option to in the late game. This seems like a great way to help you dominate the board and I just love limited cards that provide value every turn."}, "Cloaked Cadet": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is great when built around and just okay when you're solely relying on Training this to draw a few cards. Keep that in mind and don't feel obligated to play this in all of your green decks. In all honesty, this is more like a Selesnya card to me, but I expect it to really shine in that archetype and be the best top end imaginable. It is a shame that this only triggers once a turn though."}, "Mulch": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Speaking of sweet self mill spells! I love Mulch and would consider it one of my favorite reprints of all time (obviously behind Thalia, Guardian of Thraben). It enables so much nonsense in constructed and limited all the while being far from too powerful. I don't know if it will spawn archetypes in Crimson Vow, but the effect is powerful enough that I think self mill decks and multicolored green decks will be very interested in this sort of effect."}, "Moldgraf Millipede": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "In the right deck this will be enormous, and even when it doesn't come in as a 10/10 it'll still usually be a 4/4 or 5/5 at worst. That's quite a high floor and ceiling, which makes me think that Moldgraf Millipede will be a very good finisher in decks that have a bunch of self mill. I could be going slightly high here, but I have high hopes for many-legged friend here."}, "Dig Up": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Again, this grade assumes that you can pay the Cleave cost. It's fine as Lay of the Land, but only a few multicolored green decks will be interested in that sort of effect. Even when you can Cleave this, neither mode is particularly special and they ultimately combine to make a fine, but unexciting playable. Diabolic Tutor just isn't that good in limited!"}, "Bramble Wurm": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Bookwurm\u2018s little brother made it all the way to Innistrad it seems! This is a way worse Pelakka Wurm, but that's okay because this will still do a great job at stabilizing the board and presenting a huge threat for the opponent to have to handle. Most green decks should be happy about topping their curve with this."}, "Apprentice Sharpshooter": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I'm probably already too big of a fan of crappy Reach creatures like this and Bird Admirer, but this is really easy to Train because it's so hard to kill in combat while still having a low power. I think this is going to perform better than it initially reads."}, "Witch's Web": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "I usually hate two mana mediocre combat tricks, but Witch's Web ain't too bad. This offers a lot for two mana, and even though it's worse than Bull's Strength, I could see this doing work when you have a lot of creatures and are beating down."}, "Toxic Scorpion": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "A two mana 1/1 Deathtouch is below rate for modern limited, and the ETB is also kind of underwhelming, which makes me see this a fine playable that you'll often bench for better two drops."}, "Sporeback Wolf": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This is a fine attacker and also a wolf, so it'll have it's place but rarely be exciting."}, "Flourishing Hunter": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This is less consistent than Honey Mammoth and a decent amount worse in my opinion, but this will still be something that the slower green decks will be interested in. There aren't many creatures that fill the same role as this, so I expect it to perform well in this format as the go-to stabilizing green top end."}, "Dawnhart Disciple": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "We got a better Garenbrig Squire here since this should trigger way more often with all the humans in the set. This will be fine in most green decks and especially shine in the Selesnya human decks. Nothing outstanding here, but a fine filler two drop."}, "Crawling Infestation": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This is honestly a really difficult card to evaluate. This triggering only once a turn and only on your turn isn't great, but I do love that the mill is a may so you don't have to worry about decking. Ultimately, this seems way too situational and easy to play around. Some decks will be able to abuse this with Exploit and whatnot, but I don't think this is an auto-include in your green decks or that it's something you should be taking early."}, "Retrieve": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This is really slow and unexciting unless you're returning two cards. If your deck is loaded with a couple Mulch then this is going to become a lot better, but if that's not the case then I don't see many noncreature permanents hitting your graveyard and fueling this. Regrowth is rarely all that good in limited unless you have some crazy spells like Flamewave or Fireball. Retrieve pretty much only getting creatures makes me see it as an expensive Raise Dead most of the time."}, "Nature's Embrace": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This is a really cool design! Getting the choice between ramp and pump is very interesting and is what will make this card playable in way more archetypes. I'm still rarely a fan of taking the turn off to do this, especially since both modes are slightly underpowered, but this isn't embarrassing to play."}, "Massive Might": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "One mana combat tricks can only be so bad I suppose, but this only seems decent in very aggressive green decks that have a bunch of large werewolves that will push a bunch of damage through after being given Trample. This should never be a high pick and is something that's going to be cut from most of your decks. There's simply better combat tricks than this around, but it's still an okay playable."}, "Snarling Wolf": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Not sure why this is back, but it's still pretty underwhelming. Maybe the most aggressive werewolf decks will want this, but even that I doubt it."}, "Sheltering Boughs": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "This is worse than it looks, but it's still playable. Three mana is a lot for a mediocre pump, and the risk of getting blown out would make me very reluctant to include this in my deck."}, "Crushing Canopy": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Classic all-time sideboard option right here. Try not to main deck this, but even if you have to it will rarely be dead."}, "Cartographer's Survey": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "This effect is designed for constructed normally and tends to fall short in limited. You're going to want to be 3+ colors and full of late game bombs before including this, but some decks can make use of this despite 95% wanting nothing to do with an Explosive Vegetation."}, "Splendid Reclamation": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "If you find a way to live the dream and bring 9 lands back, then more power to you. I'm just gonna continue using good creatures and removal to get my wins."}, "Bramble Armor": {"Rate": "0.5", "Desc": "I assumed that this would be awful in Midnight Hunt, and somehow it was even worse than I initially thought. This is an awful equipment, and you should never play this unless you're desperate for playables."}};
