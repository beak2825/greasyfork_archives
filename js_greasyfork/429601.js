  let reviews = [["Cave of the Frost Dragon", "B", "Flying on a decent body is a really big game on manlands. It\u2019s very easy to imagine a board stall or late game scenario where you finish off a weakened opponent by attacking for 3 every turn until they\u2019re dead. You can also just hold it up for their turn, and use it to block. Either way, it\u2019s kind of like having an extra spell, no investment required."], ["+2 Mace", "C-", "+2/+2 is a massive buff, making anything a big threat. It\u2019s great on fliers, but even random tokens will need answering, and obviously equipment are repeatable so this can add up to a lot of value over the course of a long game. Boros has a few equipment payoffs, but they mostly add up to stats increases on your 2 drops, with Bruenor Battlehammer being the only really substantial payoff and that\u2019s just one uncommon. As such, I doubt you\u2019re going to ever want multiples of these with such an expensive equip cost and wouldn\u2019t take it too highly. There\u2019s plenty of other equipment it\u2019s competing with anyway."], ["Arborea Pegasus", "C", "This is a solid effect on a reasonable if unexciting body, often functioning as a 2/3 flier that deals 3-4 damage. It\u2019s still nothing too exciting but I doubt you cut the first copy or two from your beatdown decks too often, and it\u2019s a good holder of equipment."], ["Blink Dog", "D+", "Phasing is a pretty weird ability to see back in standard sets, but it\u2019s pretty nice with Equipment since those phase out with the creature so you don\u2019t have to pay the equip cost again if you save the dog from removal or a trick. Equipping and buffing are the best things to do with a 1/1 double strike anyway, and I would only really be looking to play this card in a deck that can do that consistently, since both body and ability are pretty overcosted. It\u2019s nice for Blink Dog that every colour has access to equipment in this set."], ["The Book of Exalted Deeds", "C-", "This card\u2019s very hard to cast, and 3 life is a pretty awkward number to have to gain in this set. There are lots of ways to gain 1 or 2 life but it\u2019s pretty hard to gain 3, outside of Potion of Healing, some Green commons that do it and putting an Equipment on the 2 mana 2/2 Lifelink. It\u2019s a lot of work and you have to get this down before doing that work. Even after you do all that work, you kind of need to get a second Angel before you\u2019re really happy \u2013 sure, that ability might win you the game if you\u2019re playing against a Simic deck or one with all aura-based removal, but most decks will have ways to deal with the creature.All in all, I think this is way too many hoops for most decks to jump through, but this card is very powerful if you do get there, and Potion of Healing specifically is very good with it."], ["Celestial Unicorn", "C+", "Lifegain being a supported theme in Selesnya, I think this is a pretty strong card. Looking at enablers, there are enough commons in just White that this will regularly make decks in other colour combinations, and then if you happen to be Selesnya, it\u2019s pretty insane. When evaluating cards like this, you want the enablers to be good cards by themselves, and Priest of Ancient Lore is completely insane, Dawnbringer Cleric seems decent, and there are plenty of Green cards that act as repeated lifegain enablers which with time can make this really colossal. It\u2019s a bit awkward that it starts as a 3/2, since it might not be able to attack well even after you get a counter, but worth it in plenty of decks nonetheless."], ["Cleric Class", "C+", "So to evaluate class cards, we need to break down each ability individually. The first ability for one mana doesn\u2019t do very much at all \u2013 you might gain 3-4 life over the course of the game in a dedicated deck. The second ability is really strong, a turn 4 play that has a lot of potential to run away with the game if you can gain life a few times after it, but the sequencing is pretty awkward \u2013 you must play your lifegain cards after you level it up, and most of them will cost less. I expect the third mode to be something you mainly use in the late game, but it\u2019s a pretty good rate if you can get to that point since you get immediate value off the second mode and get to return your best creature. The third mode does cost 10 mana total, but being able to split it up makes it a lot more palatable \u2013 you can spend your turn 4 and 5 doing this if you want, but you probably want to wait since you won\u2019t have a great creature in your yard yet. All in all, I think this card is a pretty powerful buildaround and mana sink, but it\u2019s slow and it doesn\u2019t go well into that many decks. It\u2019s at its best in Selesnya with some of the Green enablers, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s awful in any slower deck either. It\u2019s not a card I expect to take super highly, but when I want it then I\u2019ll take it over pretty much anything."], ["Cloister Gargoyle", "C+", "This card strikes me as a premier Venture payoff, blocking well in the early game and then being a powerful threat later on. It puts you a solid 1/4 of the way along to enabling it anyway, so you only need three more Ventures after it, and it\u2019s good friends with Ranger Hawk and Planar Ally. This isn\u2019t great in the more dedicated beatdown decks, and I expect White to go down that path a lot, but you can just run out your other 3 drops first and spend some time equipping or whatever in those decks, and then have this finish the game later on. I do expect slower White decks to still be very viable though. It\u2019s worth noting that purely defensive statlines get way worse in multiples \u2013 you probably don\u2019t want other walls with this, and multiple copies can lead to some awkward draws until they\u2019re turned on."], ["Dancing Sword", "B", "+2/+1 with an equip cost of only 1 is a really good rate, and this is kind of like a split card in that if you\u2019re running out of creatures, you can just have it become a threat by sacrificing the Equipment side of it. I expect common case will be for you to expend all your creatures that can get good attacks in with the +2/+1, and then make the flier late game or when they\u2019re on a life total, and that sounds like an extremely good deal for such a small mana investment. A major weakness of Equipment is their being bad if you\u2019re out of creatures or if you draw too many Equipment, and this is a solid way to mitigate that."], ["Dawnbringer Cleric", "C", "Modal cards gain a lot by having the option to use the best effect for your current situation, and this has a lot of decent effects. The main draw is if you get to destroy an Enchantment, of which there are more in this set than most, between Classes and common enchantment removals, which White, Black, and Blue all have. Destroying a Class after they\u2019ve levelled it up a bunch is going to feel absolutely filthy. I would give this a C+, but the failcase of a 1/3 that gains 2 is mediocre. A 1/3 gets invalidated quite quickly as the game goes on, so drawing multiples of this card will be awful for decks without plentiful lifegain payoffs, and they\u2019re very unlikely to have two Enchantments worth killing in the average game (oftentimes they won\u2019t even have one). Ultimately, I wouldn\u2019t take the first copy too highly but I\u2019d be happy to pick it up later on."], ["Delver's Torch", "D+", "Repeated venturing is really powerful since the best effects are at the end of the dungeons, and this can provide a lot of value if you\u2019re able to attack unimpeded. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think that will happen that often, since the buff is mediocre and the equip cost is very expensive. I don\u2019t think this will do enough in decks that don\u2019t have plenty of evasive creatures, and even then those decks won\u2019t usually want to pay 4 mana to do something so minor."], ["Devoted Paladin", "C-", "Here\u2019s a really nice effect, reminiscent of Dawnfeather Eagle which was a busted card in Amonkhet Remastered. This is an easy way to win a race, since Vigilance means you can get a big alpha strike in without much fear of being hit back. Still, Dawnfeather Eagle being able to fly and finish your now weakened opponent off was a big draw of the card, and you don\u2019t have room for tons of 5s, so I think this is decent but replaceable. Mostly you might have room for 1 of these, alongside your hopefully better top end."], ["Divine Smite", "F", "I straight up wouldn\u2019t play this card outside the sideboard, since it\u2019s amazing against Black decks and terrible otherwise \u2013 phasing is even worse than bounce, since they don\u2019t have to pay for the card again. If you are playing best-of-three, then look to take it reasonably highly in the latter half of the pack, but since it only hits one colour, I\u2019d still be taking many fine playables over it."], ["Dragon's Disciple", "D+", "There are way more Dragons at common and uncommon than usual, including a couple at 4 mana even, but most cost 6 or 7 so I don\u2019t expect you to have too many. A lot of the rares are also Dragons, and cheaper ones at that, so I expect some decks to have several but I still don\u2019t think this card is amazing. 2 mana 2/4 is a solid rate, but the failcase of a 2 mana 1/3 isn\u2019t great and Ward 1 doesn\u2019t really add much to your Dragons. With four dragons, you\u2019re about 63% to have one in hand on turn 2 (learn how to calculate this here), but I think four is really the maximum a normal deck will have and that\u2019s still a good proportion of games where you\u2019re playing a mediocre card."], ["Dwarfhold Champion", "C+", "This is a good aggressive 2 drop, since having 3 power means it can attack into many 3 drops and it scales well into the mid-game, since this ability makes it into a big threat alongside any Equipment. There are plenty of those available, and the ones that equip for free the first time seem especially potent with this. Some decks won\u2019t really care, but I think this is strong enough in the right deck to warrant a low C+."], ["Flumph", "D-", "Even a 0/4 defender flier would not be an exciting card, and this is an ability that usually hurts you. If you\u2019re playing this card, you\u2019re a slow deck so they probably have a lower curve than you, so they benefit more from card draw because they\u2019ll run out sooner and be able to cast more spells per turn. They also get the first opportunity to cast whatever is drawn, since it\u2019s their turn. I really don\u2019t foresee ever playing this card, unless I\u2019m truly desperate for 2 drops or I need to sideboard it in because they have a lot of fliers it stops."], ["Gloom Stalker", "D+", "This card has a pretty mediocre body, and dungeons aren\u2019t going to be trivial to complete with the shortest ones having four rungs (I would not recommend taking the Oubliette path on Tomb of Annihilation very often!) \u2013 this is very much a late game proposition. Once enabled, this attacks okay, but still not really that well unless you have ways to buff it up or grant it evasion, since 2 power just isn\u2019t that much. This is a card that would be so much better as a 3/2, and great as a 3/3."], ["Grand Master of Flowers", "B-", "This first ability is a very awkward form of removal, but it works on enough things that I think the card is pretty solid. This is a good reason to play Monk of the Open Hand in your deck, since being able to fetch them up for free is pretty powerful, but the card is mediocre so drawing them without this is going to kind of suck \u2013 still worth playing a couple though. It\u2019s not the kind of planeswalker that takes over a game with ease, but if you are able to protect it for long enough then it does just win the game (at least if they don\u2019t have aura or exile-based removal), and I think that will happen enough to be a solid pick. The ideal case is you\u2019re ahead or in a board stall when you play this, or that it\u2019s removing the main thing threatening you, but there\u2019ll certainly be some games where it\u2019s stuck in your hand for ages."], ["Guardian of Faith", "C+", "A 3/2 Flash Vigilance for 3 mana is a decent rate, and this one can save your creatures from removal. This is often worse than flickering the creature (exiling it then returning it to the battlefield) because you don\u2019t get to reuse its enter the battlefield effects, but it is good with equipment and auras, since they don\u2019t fall off. It\u2019s a bit hard to cast, and you sometimes won\u2019t be able to play it on 3."], ["Half-Elf Monk", "C", "A 1/4 Vigilance is an awful statline for a 4-drop, but this is a powerful ability. It\u2019s cute since you can sometimes sneak some damage through by attacking with it first and then tapping something in combat. It blocks well, but you can\u2019t both block and tap something down, so this does strike me as a pretty awkward card all-round. Still, tappers are great \u2013 it\u2019s repeatable removal in the late game, the ability isn\u2019t too expensive, and I think it\u2019ll be fine in some slower decks, maybe lifegain decks. Beatdown decks will want to stay far away, unless they really have no other ways to get attackers through. It\u2019s a reasonable target for equipment too, since Vigilance is very good on big creatures."], ["Icingdeath, Frost Tyrant", "A-", "This card is a bomb, since it has an amazing body and gives you an insane equipment when it dies. You do need to be attacking to get the most value out of it, since the tap ability only works on the offense and the body isn\u2019t great at blocking, but just trading off and being an Equipment up is a fine place to be as well. It\u2019s a bit weak against aura-based removal, and this set does have plenty of it."], ["Ingenious Smith", "C+", "There\u2019s really a lot of equipment in the set, and this card is insane if you do manage to spike an equipment or other artifact off its first ability. Even if you don\u2019t, Black and Red have a ton of treasure generators, all of which buff this card and some of which are repeatable so I think it\u2019ll be really good in some decks and awful in others. I\u2019d take it pretty highly and be very willing to cut it if I don\u2019t have at least 5-7 artifacts or treasure generators (artifacts and repeatable sources being better, so you need fewer)."], ["Keen-Eared Sentry", "D", "I think this is pretty close to just a vanilla 2/1 for 2. Sure, sometimes you\u2019ll stop them discarding you or burning you out, and maybe in 1 in 10 games you\u2019ll hinder them because they won\u2019t be able to venture twice, but being able to venture once is almost always enough. Play this if you desperately need 2 drops, and otherwise stay far away."], ["Loyal Warhound", "C+", "This is an excellent card to play on the draw on turn 3, since it\u2019s fantastic value at that point. I would be happy to play it in any deck just for that opportunity, and the failcase of a 3/1 Vigilance for 2 isn\u2019t too bad. Vigilance isn\u2019t super useful on low toughness creatures, but it is once you equip them!"], ["Minimus Containment", "C+", "This is reasonably efficient removal, but will be really awkward to use early \u2013 ramping them up to a big thing and fixing their colours can really come back to bite you, especially since Black and Red have some synergies surrounding Treasure tokens. It\u2019s also a little expensive for what you get, preventing you from double spelling. Still, at least it sacrifices if they use it so they can\u2019t leave it around to eventually draw enchantment removal. It\u2019s still reasonable removal, since the drawback becomes less and less relevant as the game goes on, but I am expecting White to be pretty aggressive and hence want to use it early. Still, I don\u2019t think many White decks will cut it \u2013 usually you\u2019ll have to be Black or Red and have plenty of better removal at that point."], ["Monk of the Open Hand", "D", "It takes a lot of work to even make this card a 2/2, and it will never scale well with the game. If you\u2019re really aggressive and low curve then maybe, but the majority of decks won\u2019t want this \u2013 it\u2019s not even good to equip."], ["Moon-Blessed Cleric", "C", "This card\u2019s understatted and it doesn\u2019t actually provide card advantage, but it provides some nice flexibility since you can get removal with it or your nice Class card, or sometimes even some insane rare enchantment (in which case you\u2019ll take it a lot higher than C). Still, it\u2019s just fine, not something you should take too highly until you have the really good hits."], ["Nadaar, Selfless Paladin", "B+", "This card is nuts, gamewinning once you enable it and generating you a ton of value before that point. It\u2019s very easy to finish a dungeon if you\u2019re able to get attacks in with this, but you can just leave it in play and make your removal spells/other venture cards into absurd draws if you can\u2019t, and it always gets at least 1/4 of the way to enabling itself."], ["Oswald Fiddlebender", "C", "In a lot of decks, this is just going to be a 2 mana 2/2. If you have treasure generation and any 1 drop artifact to get, it starts to get much more exciting, or if you can sacrifice stuff like Potion of Healing to tutor your Equipment out, or just sacrifice those Equipment to get better ones. I think it\u2019s hard to actually get value off it, but it\u2019ll be very interesting in some decks."], ["Paladin Class", "A-", "This Class enchantment strikes me as a lower end bomb. The first mode again doesn\u2019t do very much, but the second mode is where you get a ton of value since Glorious Anthem is fantastic in Limited, even for 4 mana. I expect the common case to be you get a bunch of creatures out then level it up and immediately attack for tons of damage. The third mode is powerful even if you only have one or two good creatures; it\u2019s a gamewinning late game mana sink and will often even be good on turn 5."], ["Paladin's Shield", "D", "This is a very mediocre trick combined with a very mediocre stats buff. In the circumstances where you are able to kill a creature with it and then have the Equipment lying around, it\u2019s pretty good value, but your creature already has to be trading for that to happen and that just doesn\u2019t happen nearly often enough. Even with cards like Dwarfhold Champion, spending two cards to make a 3/5 doesn\u2019t exactly fill me with joy, so maybe you play it with Bruenor Battlehammer or if you\u2019re really desperate for equipment synergies, but I\u2019m not into it."], ["Planar Ally", "C+", "I\u2019m quite fond of this card, since it has a reasonable statline and generates a lot of value over the course of the game \u2013 this is one of the few Venture cards where getting repeated triggers isn\u2019t at all unlikely. I foresee it fitting well into all sorts of decks, since the Dungeons have a vast and varied range of effects so it can chip away for some extra damage when it needs to, make some Goblin tokens, scry, or even draw some cards. Still, you still don\u2019t want too many 5s and it\u2019s pretty bad when you\u2019re behind on board."], ["Plate Armor", "B", "Now, this is an Equipment I won\u2019t be passing very often. +3/+3 is a gigantic buff, which will make any creature one of the best things on the board, and equip 3 is a very reasonable rate for that even if you don\u2019t have other Equipments. Ward 1 is some nice gravy, and can certainly have a big impact if they\u2019re relying on expensive removal or trying to double spell. It does combine well with other Equipment too, since sometimes you\u2019ll just be able to go full voltron and make every creature into a bomb, but drawing too many Equipment and too few creatures can be gamelosing. Don\u2019t use this as an excuse to put too many in \u2013 you basically never want to play more than 3-4 unless they make creatures themselves."], ["Portable Hole", "C", "This kind of card tends to be overrated. Mana value 2 or less is normally pretty unexciting against creatures, since your opponent sometimes won\u2019t have a 2 drop play or not ones that are worth killing e.g. ones that already got value from an enter the battlefield effect. Compare to Shock, which often kills some proportion of 3 and 4 drops and still does something against bigger creatures. The saving grace for this card is that it hits nonland permanents, including every Class, a bunch of equipment, and some stuff like Bag of Holding, so there are more targets in the set for it than usual, but in some matchups, it will be really weak."], ["Potion of Healing", "D", "This is pretty comparable to Revitalize, but it has the upside that you can draw the card early on and then leave it in play until you need it. Revitalize is pretty mediocre in Limited, and this is a card you need a bunch of synergy with, whether that\u2019s plenty of lifegain payoffs, ways to flicker it, ways to sacrifice it for value\u2026 it does enough in some decks, but you shouldn\u2019t play it unless you have a good reason. There isn\u2019t much direct artifact synergy outside of rares and mythics, but this is good with a surprising number of them, like Teleportation Circle, Oswald Fiddlebender, and The Blackstaff of Waterdeep."], ["Priest of Ancient Lore", "B", "If this weren\u2019t White\u2019s best common, it would be a shock, since it\u2019s an incredibly easy 2 for 1 and a free way to enable your lifegain synergies. Being able to trade for their 2 drop, or even double block, and not lose a card is fantastic and this is good at any point, early or late. It\u2019s not quite as good as busted card Sarulf\u2019s Packmate from Kaldheim, since this statline isn\u2019t great without buffs, but there are lots of Equipment running around to help it along."], ["Rally Maneuver", "C", "This card has a lot of potential upside and it is a very pushed combat trick. In some scenarios, it will be absolutely gamewinning, killing two creatures and gaining you a bunch of life, but that\u2019s really very rare and it\u2019s expensive enough that it\u2019s quite hard to hold up for the right time. It\u2019s not easy to get the exact scenario where two of your creatures are attacking and being blocked, or vice versa, and this kind of card has the tendency to rot in your hand while you wait for the right circumstance which may not come. I\u2019d recommend just collecting a solid 1 for 1 and gaining some life when the opportunity presents itself when you play this card. Remember that you can\u2019t target the same creature with both modes, which matters a lot \u2013 you can\u2019t gain any life if you only have one creature, and usually it means you can only pick your best creature for one of the options."], ["Ranger's Hawk", "D+", "This card is an okay thing to equip and does something in the late game, but it doesn\u2019t do either thing particularly well \u2013 you would much rather be equipping creatures that are decent by themselves, since that gives you a lot more game in situations where you don\u2019t draw your Equipment or when there\u2019s something better to equip, and a 1/1 flier just doesn\u2019t do enough in most games. The late game mana sink does help a lot, but having to tap two creatures to do it at sorcery speed is rough unless you\u2019re ahead or in a board stall. Still, I think it will happen and be okay often enough that I consider this okay filler, and it does get better if you do have a lot of Equipment or other Venture cards so you\u2019re getting good value immediately."], ["Steadfast Paladin", "C+", "I expect beatdown decks to be quite strong in this set, especially when you\u2019re playing other White decks, so this is pretty desirable to begin with. Then you factor in all the Equipment running around, and this can just run away with some games. Getting a big life advantage makes your opponents\u2019 evasive creatures much worse, and gives you a lot more time to draw into stuff/threaten more aggressive attacks. This is good in slow and fast White decks alike, just a premium 2 drop."], ["Teleportation Circle", "B-", "The whole joke with this card is that you use it with enter the battlefield (ETB) abilities to generate repeatable value, and it\u2019s very good with cards Potion of Healing or Priest of Ancient Lore, and decent with ETB venture effects like Cloister Gargoyle or Veteran Dungeoneer, all of which are in White. When you factor in cards from other colours, I think this can be a very powerful buildaround if you pick it up early. Bouncing stuff every turn with Air-Cult Elemental or repeatedly destroying creatures with Black Dragon can come up, and the failcase if you don\u2019t draw an ETB effect is you can sometimes use it to knock a debilitating aura off one of your creatures, of which this set has more than usual. Remember that it also untaps the creature, effectively granting it Vigilance. I wouldn\u2019t play this card with fewer than four or five good enter the battlefield abilities to recur (remember that if they\u2019re just gaining a few life, that\u2019s not good enough unless you also have plentiful lifegain payoffs), but I think it\u2019s very powerful once you hit that. The faster the set, the worse this card is, and I do expect some beatdown decks to be good, so we\u2019ll see how that pans out."], ["Veteran Dungeoneer", "C", "This is quite deck-dependent, since it\u2019s pretty bad if you have very few ways to Venture and actively good if you have a bunch of other ways. Venture in general gets much better the more you have, but especially 1-shots that come out in the later game, like this one. 3/4 is a pretty bad statline for beatdown decks, so you probably want to stay away unless you have lots of Venture in those."], ["White Dragon", "B-", "Well, dragons remain good in Limited. This one combines an excellent body that will demand an answer in short order with the Frost Trickster ability, allowing you two attacks through a big creature or staving off one of its attacks, and that\u2019s a fantastic rate. It\u2019s still just a B- since there are other Dragons flying around, some with even more powerful abilities, but if you do happen to be playing some copies of Dragon\u2019s Disciple or Dragon\u2019s Fire then it does get a little better."], ["You Hear Something on Watch", "C+", "This is a pretty solid card whether you\u2019re attacking or blocking. You almost always want to use the 5 damage mode but if you\u2019re going for lethal damage or can turn a trade into eating a creature with the +1/+1 then it\u2019s very good, and it\u2019s efficient in either circumstance. I don\u2019t think you want too many of these, and they do get worse if you\u2019re aggressive but not a go-wide sort of deck \u2013 since they won\u2019t be attacking as much and you won\u2019t have many creatures to buff. I expect aggro decks this set to mostly be going tall rather than wide, so that will be pretty common case. I think it still narrowly makes C+ nonetheless, but I wouldn\u2019t take the second copy as highly since this is definitely the sort of card that can get stuck in your hand."], ["You're Ambushed on the Road", "D", "Both modes on this card are weak and situational \u2013 bouncing your creature is card disadvantage unless it\u2019s in response to a removal spell or if the card has an especially good enter the battlefield (ETB) effect, and the trick mode only has an effect in very specific scenarios. Even with the flexibility of both modes, I don\u2019t think this card is good in nearly enough scenarios that I\u2019ll be happy to play it."],

I would want 7+ Treasure generators, including a couple of repeatable ones, before I was willing to play this card, and even then we\u2019re talking an incredibly late game play that\u2019s still not incredibly exciting."], ["Trelasarra, Moon Dancer ", "B", "You need to get quite a lot of lifegain triggers before this card is really great, but it doesn\u2019t start off bad at all and there are some repeatable ones like Cleric Class and Prosperous Innkeeper that will singlehandedly make this amazing.

I think that ensuring you never flood by pitching your lands and expensive cards, and then being huge card advantage late game, all at a pretty reasonable price, is good enough to warrant a high grade. That being said, there is more maindeckable artifact removal running around than usual, and that is incredibly good against this card \u2013 if you don\u2019t have 4 mana up, you lose all the cards you looted away.

You don\u2019t want to use this until you have few cards in hand, because it might make you discard your hand, but you wouldn\u2019t really want to until then anyway!

Some decks may not want this, if they have too many other slow things going on or there isn\u2019t space (this goes back to decks being more packed with creatures, Equipment, and your other utility spells), but I think that will be pretty rare and there will be more decks where you\u2019re happy."], ["Dungeon Map", "C", "This is a pretty medium way to use 3 mana early, but it bridges the gap to 5 mana faster and there are tons of really powerful 5 drops in the set. Still, you definitely risk falling behind versus a fast deck by having this as your turn 3 play. In the late game, this is solid since it\u2019s a cheap mana sink that mitigates flood.

Rappel Down is some nice upside alongside this, but 4 mana is quite a lot to have to pay at sorcery speed. I don\u2019t think this combination of abilities is good enough.

Still, early on this is powerful enough to be worth it \u2013 you just play a 2 drop then equip this on turn 3 and your opponent probably is going to have a really hard time removing it and it\u2019ll deal way more damage than you did yourself. A beatdown deck should be able to capitalise and overwhelm them so long as you\u2019re not flooding out. In the late game, you can just move around and have it give small buffs, and it\u2019s not exciting but it\u2019s still doing something minor \u2013 since you\u2019re no longer paying life, you can start to hold lands in hand and such.

My main problem with it is that a lot of decks really want their creatures to stick around so they can equip them later or use them for Green spells like Spoils of the Hunt, or for tricks\u2026 this set especially seems kind of bad for this sort of effect, at least if you can\u2019t immediately equip it the turn after you play it.

Even if you have 4 or 5 Dwarfhold Champions, using your two cards to make a 3/4 Ward 1 really doesn\u2019t sound exciting to me, it has actual anti-synergy with Bruenor Battlehammer since you can just pay something like Duelling Rapier that would ordinarily cost mana to equip and does more, and there really isn\u2019t much else in the set that has direct synergy with Equipments. Making Plate Armor cheaper is not worth spending a card either. If you\u2019re desperate for Equipment, just play Spare Dagger or some other card that has a noticeable effect."], ["Mimic", "D-", "You never want to spend real cards to make Treasure Tokens, and this ability costs too much mana for too mediocre a body.

The five Treasure tokens mode just isn\u2019t relevant enough of the time by the time you get this out, and if you have synergies then it\u2019s a 40% chance so you can\u2019t rely on it at all. Sometimes rolling a 20 is actually worse than rolling 10-19, which is the actual payoff here, but paying 7 mana to draw three isn\u2019t even good.

It\u2019s not a full extra source because you have to choose 1, but it\u2019s kind of the best you can do this set and that\u2019s why I would look for a couple rather than just have one."], ["Temple of the Dragon Queen", "C+", "This is sort of the same card as Evolving Wilds, except okay the deck-thinning on the former is some tiny % beneficial to you and this can come into play untapped every so often. Other than that, just read what I wrote for Evolving Wilds and play this in any deck."], ["Treasure Vault", "D", "I don\u2019t think enough Treasure synergies exist for me to be really excited by this card, outside of some pretty rare decks. It\u2019s good with Kalain, Reclusive Painter and Ingenious Smith, and it\u2019s fixing for the late game so ordinarily I would be happy enough but\u2026 This is all kind of undone by it being a colourless land. I think the fixing is bad enough this set that you shouldn\u2019t play colourless lands unless you have a good reason to do so or happen to have enough fixing through Treasures or whatever \u2013 but the Treasure generators require coloured mana themselves and often cost quite a few mana.
