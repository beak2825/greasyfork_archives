UPDATE: MY FIXED UNDISCORD VERSION WORKS, BUT I SWITCHED TO DISCRUB BECAUSE UNDISCORD IS 💩. I MADE THE SWITCH BACK IN JULY 2025 AND THAT IS WHEN I UNLISTED THIS USERSCRIPT. SINCE THIS USERSCRIPT IS UNLISTED, I AM SURPRISED THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL INSTALLING IT. THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF NEW INSTALLS SINCE AUGUEST 2025. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T USE THIS USERSCRIPT ANYMORE. GO TO THE CHROME WEB STORE AND INSTALL THE DISCRUB EXTENSION INSTEAD. IT DOES THE SAME THING, BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER AND IS BEING ACTIVELY MAINTAINED. IT IS OPEN SOURCE, RELIABLE, AND HAS HUNDREDS OF POSITIVE REVIEWS. I USED IT TO DELETE 40,000 DM MESSAGES WITH NO PROBLEMS.

USE THIS INSTEAD:
Discrub

Notes: A working alternative to Undiscord that you can install from Chrome Web Store.

Go to the following page if you want to know the backstory of this userscript that you have installed and why I made it Unlisted:
