  let reviews = {"The Wandering Emperor": {"Rate": "5.0", "Desc": "A busted bomb planeswalker that is going to make waves in constructed as well. It's highly unlikely anyone will be playing around a mythic rare and this will just destroy them in combat. Hard removal plus some life gain with a planeswalker they can't attack until their next turn is some serious value. That's not even getting into if they get destroyed by the first strike while you're gaining loyalty. It even pumps out samurais to protect itself. Good when you're ahead, behind, or at parity for only four mana. Yep, it's busto."}, "Ao, the Dawn Sky": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "Are you in the market for a large, undercosted flyer that your opponent never wants to kill? Then this whole cycle of busted mythic Dragons is exactly what you are looking for. Even without the death triggers this would be a strictly better Serra Angel. Your opponent is never going to want to attack into this or kill it unless they want you to permanently super-size your entire board."}, "The Restoration of Eiganjo": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Replaces itself right off the bat, provides you the option to either ramp or play a two mana creature for free, then turns into a very annoying creature. I love all these abilities and will happily slam this pick one."}, "Michiko's Reign of Truth": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "With the right deck this can put in some real work. Being able to add four or five power to an attacker two turns in a row is either going to put a serious hurting on their life total or take out a couple of creatures. Flipping into a decently statted creature all for only two mana seems like a deal I'm looking to make. Keep in mind you won't be playing this on turn two, but it's a great way to enable double spelling."}, "Lion Sash": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Scavenging Ooze as an equipment creature seems pretty great to me. Every time they trade for the equipped creature, it just makes the next one bigger. It's not going to be difficult to get enough counters on this to put your opponent in a chump or die scenario. It would be higher, but people are going to be playing main board artifact removal."}, "Kyodai, Soul of Kamigawa": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Phantom monster on steroids. The dream is to have your opponent attack in when you can protect another creature and eat something with this. This being a rare means that they are less likely to play around that scenario. If nothing else, it's a save another creature play a decent flyer for only four mana. You can ignore the five mana activation because that's just not likely to happen."}, "Farewell": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This is a lot of sweeper in just one card. Extremely powerful and with the versatility that sweepers usually lack. It lets you build up a vehicle army and walk your opponent into just the creature portion without looking suspicious. Opponent played a bunch of sagas and artifact creatures, well you can sweep those away while leaving your creatures intact. At five mana this would have been an all time banger"}, "Cloudsteel Kirin": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "A 3/2 Flyer for three mana is a very solid aggressive card. The key here is that if you are behind it can also reconfigure onto a creature to give it everyone's favorite text of you can't lose the game. Just demands removal or gives you all the time in the world to find a way to win."}, "Touch the Spirit Realm": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is going to be played as a banishing light almost every single time. The option to protect your own creature isn't nothing and can be quite good with comes into play abilities. The channel also plays well with Norika Yamazaki, the Poet by letting you protect your creature and then still play it as a removal spell."}, "March of Otherworldly Light": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Decent instant speed removal where you are always paying one more mana than your opponent. The exile effect along with coverage for artifacts and enchantments makes up for that extra mana. You'll never really want to pitch a real card to make it cheaper, but it's nice to have the option in an emergency."}, "Invoke Justice": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This cycle is going to be really hard to cast in your average draft and should usually be considered to be at least seven drops. That said, this is a hugely powerful card with two game changing effects. In a set full of sagas and artifacts bringing back any permanent is significantly better than just return any creature and that's not even getting into pumping up the jams on your side. I would take this pick one and try to draft accordingly to make the mana work."}, "Sunblade Samurai": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I love any decently statted creature that has the option to get a land instead. You're happy to draw it at almost any point in the game."}, "Selfless Samurai": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Great on rate creature that really pushes the attacks alone archetype forward. Being able to add lifelink to your attacker makes it really difficult to race when the rest of your side is still back on defense. Add in the backup option to protect any of your creatures and that's a lot of card for only two mana."}, "Intercessor's Arrest": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "A better Arrest that can hit any permanent and even prevents crewing. Despite the hate against pacifism effects, I will intercede and say that this will be just fine."}, "Imperial Oath": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a decent top end for an aggressive deck with a built in go wide strategy. The scry three is almost worth a card on its own and should get you to the trick or removal you need to win the game the next turn. Just make sure to take the oath not to play too many of these."}, "Hotshot Mechanic": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "While Savannah Lions isn't what it used to be, this is still a great aggressive creature to start the game off with. This one can even pilot as if it had four power letting it crew Surgehacker Mech for only one mana."}, "Born to Drive": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Born to Drive lives up to its name by channeling out two pilots who can really get those vehicles moving in a hurry. While that's the usual mode this will be used in, the aura portion also has great potential on an evasive creature to end games in a hurry. Versatile and efficient for only three mana."}, "Blade-Blizzard Kitsune": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is one of the few ninjas that I think will be played more for its normal cost than with ninjitsu. A 2/2 double striker for three in an equipment set can put in some real work especially in combination with the attacks alone theme. I just can't get over the art on this because it looks like they drew a giant armored body followed by sticking a little misaligned fox head on top."}, "Banishing Slash": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Don't banish this to your sideboard. There are going to be enough artifacts and enchantments floating around for Banishing Slash to both always have a target and have a good chance of making you a creature. Being able to kill a creature and make a 2/2 of your own is a lot of value for only two mana."}, "When We Were Young": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Decent trick that is much, much better if you meet the bonus requirements. Gaining eight or more life can swing a game out of nowhere while a double pump usually requires a bad block to really take advantage of. Per usual this will be better in the first couple weeks when people don't know the tricks."}, "Spirited Companion": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Elvish visionary in doggo form. It's just common knowledge that doggos make everything better. Bouncing this back with ninjitsu is going to feel so good. It's also a card people never want to trade for because they feel like they lost the exchange."}, "Imperial Subduer": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Mitigates the problem of trading your two toughness three drop for a two drop by tapping it down when it attacks. Later in the game it puts in work by tapping their best blocker when you are running the \u201cexalted\u201d strategy."}, "Golden-Tail Disciple": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "A worse Kindly Ancester , but still a decent defensive creature. Lifelink plays well with equipment and being an enchantment helps trigger a bunch of payoffs."}, "Dragonfly Suit": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "The cheap crew cost should keep this one easily flying at your opponent turn after turn. Just use whichever creature you just played or a dork that's outlived it's usefulness to pilot this mech to victory."}, "Wanderer's Intervention": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Just another version of Divine Arrow. Same as always, it's mediocre filler that makes the cut about half the time. If you are killing an attacker, it's very important for you to do it before blockers so you don't get wrecked by ninjitsu."}, "Seven-Tail Mentor": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Similar to Gavony Silversmith except that you have to wait for it to die to get the second counter. It would be a much better card if it was a leaves play ability instead of a death trigger because of the plethora of ways to abuse it."}, "Repel the Vile": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This has enough versatility that I'm willing to mainboard one of these, but will happily grab a couple more for the sideboard. Every deck you play against should have at least one target between enchantment creatures, sagas, or just big critters."}, "Regent's Authority": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "The value of tricks goes up in any set that contains ninjitsu because it incentivizes your opponents to block. This is still pretty unspectacular, but makes decent filler if it's what your deck is looking for."}, "Norika Yamazaki, the Poet": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "A solid addition to the \u201cexalted\u201d deck. A great line is to channel away an enchantment like Born to Drive and bring it right back with this. That said, I am not a fan of three mana, two toughness creatures so this is going to require other samurai or warriors to get in there to produce value."}, "Mothrider Patrol": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "A slightly different take on the tapper by being a cheap evasive threat with an expensive tap cost. Bump this up half a grade if you have any ninjas that this enables."}, "Kitsune Ace": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Another critter that falls under the bear with upside category. If you're running vehicles the free first strike is a decent payoff from piloting, but if not it's just a vanilla fox."}, "Imperial Recovery Unit": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "The lack of evasion really holds this back. Even with a decent body, it's not hard to trade off for this if it's going to be a long term value engine. It also requires something cheap to recover, otherwise it's just a 3/4 that requires a pilot."}, "Go-Shintai of Shared Purpose": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Good News: Shrines are back baby! Bad News: Now they are creatures which actually makes them worse by being vulnerable to more removal. This can be a solid engine for a go wide strategy that kicks into high gear if you have another shrine, but nothing to write home about."}, "The Fall of Lord Konda": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Being able to hit something of mana value four or greater instead of basing it off of toughness keeps this from being relegated to the sideboard. It's important to note that it can't hit vehicles unless they activate them first. The second ability will rarely do anything and the creature is just a speedbump that at least replaces itself. Too slow to be considered good, but bad removal is still removal."}, "Era of Enlightenment": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This is a saga where I would much rather just have the creature with nothing attached. A 2/2 first strike can put in work in the early turns, but by the time it shows up on turn 4 it's going to be outclassed. At least the scry two is still useful later in the game, but then your creature is just a future speed bump."}, "Eiganjo Exemplar": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This can attack as a 3/2 on its own so it's not embarrassing for a two drop. A key part of the \u201cexalted\u201d deck since your dork still does something later in the game so bump it up half a grade there."}, "Brilliant Restoration": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This isn't the constructed plant that it appears to be on first glance. There are actually a ton of artifacts and enchantments that this could potentially bring back and could end up being a four or five for one. To be fair, it does nothing early and is just a dead draw for most of the game. Completely worthless in some decks, but has game winning potential in the right deck."}, "Befriending the Moths": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "The deck that wants to give a creature +1+1 and flying isn't usually the same deck that is in the market for a 2/4 that comes out on turn 6 at the earliest. While most of the sagas are well designed, this one is a huge miss for me."}, "Sky-Blessed Samurai": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "You need at least two enchantments to make this reasonable to cast. In the Selesnya enchantments deck, this could be a solid, but unspectacular curve topper. In most decks, it's just going to be too expensive to bother playing."}, "Lucky Offering": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "I hope you're lucky enough to not have to run this card mainboard. While artifact removal is fine in this set, the restriction of only being 3 or less makes me want to leave it in the sideboard. Bonus points for the cat art though."}, "Light-Paws, Emperor's Voice": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "A bear with upside is never terrible. That said, this requires some pretty specific things to happen to get extra value out of it. If you happen to already be playing multiple auras of different costs, then this is a worthy addition to your deck. Most of the time it's just a curve filler, but your opponent doesn't know that and might use real removal on it."}, "Light the Way": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "Even with power creep you can't expect too much from your one mana tricks. I'd board this in against a deck with a lot of removal and that's about it."}, "Ancestral Katana": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This family heirloom should probably be left up on the mantle place. It's expensive, clunky and pales in comparison to the creature equipment in the set. Even in the attacks alone deck, this only moves up to a 2.0."}, "Tamiyo, Compleated Sage": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Poor Tamiyo got turned into a Phyrexian robot, but still has that spark for planeswalking. Per usual a planewalker that can protect itself and provide value is pretty good. I know, I was just as shocked as you were. Her ultimate is nowhere near game ending though so she feels like another well designed planeswalker that doesn't break the game."}, "Satoru Umezawa": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Are you ready for ninja shenanigans? Because Satoru is all about ninja shenanigans. Giving every creature in your hand ninjitsu is going to lead to some pretty wild and crazy things happening like dropping your splashed bomb that they haven't seen the color of. On top of that the first time you activate ninjitsu each turn you get a free Anticipate. I'm going to love playing this card and hate playing against it."}, "Kotose, the Silent Spider": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Kotose silently sneaks over and steals you the best card out of your opponent's graveyard. That's some pretty serious value as long as she survives long enough for you to play it. The other part of her ability isn't as irrelevant as you would think when you might be able to snag an extra removal spell out of their deck."}, "Kaito Shizuki": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This is the perfect power level for a mythic planeswalker in limited. It provides a card advantage engine that is useful, but not overwhelming. It's difficult to answer cleanly, but doesn't set you too far back to remove it. Kudos to WotC's design team for nailing it on this one."}, "Silver-Fur Master": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Ninjitsuing in Master Splinter could lead to the lord effect absolutely destroying some previously decent blocks. Just being a two mana lord for a common creature type is almost always a very good card and this also throws in some cheaper ninjitsu action. Just a great reason to be drafting the ninja deck."}, "Raiyuu, Storm's Edge": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "While insane in the right deck, this is still pretty good even without a lot of other attacks alone triggers. In that case it can get in for three on its own followed by your entire squad still bum rushing your opponent during the second attack step."}, "Isshin, Two Heavens as One": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "In the Boros \u201cexalted\u201d deck this is easily worth the splash as doubling abilities can just get downright silly with tapping opposing creatures and pumping up the jams. If you're playing any other deck, don't mess your mana up just to splash a 3/4."}, "Hinata, Dawn-Crowned": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Splashing the third color for this shouldn't be too difficult between the cycle of dual lands and Uncharted Haven. Even with that fixing, you should still expect to play it more often on turn five or six than on turn four. That's still totally fine for a 4/4 flying trample that gives all of your creatures pseudo ward."}, "Greasefang, Okiba Boss": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "It feels pretty greasy to play an above rate creature that comes with a repeatable value engine. There is a very fine line to walk between running enough vehicles to take advantage of this while still having enough pilots to crew them."}, "Gloomshrieker": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Now this is a proper Gravedigger. Getting any permanent is such a huge upgrade over only creatures in a format filled with sagas and artifacts. Having menace means that this might actually get through to live the ninjitsu dream of being bounced for even more value."}, "Risona, Asari Commander": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "As long as you are the aggressor this can be a real pain for your opponent to deal with, but all it takes is a single 1/1 poking you back to leave Risona vulnerable. The floor of a 3/3 haste for three is still a pretty solid card that always makes the cut in the right colors."}, "Naomi, Pillar of Order": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This signpost uncommon is ordering me to play artifacts and enchantments to accumulate extra value. This will probably end up trading in combat the first time it attacks, but getting two free 2/2s with vigilance thrown in is a deal worth pursuing."}, "Jukai Naturalist": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is a huge beating on curve by acting as a mana dork while still giving you the option to attack with lifelink. If you curve Generous Visitor into this you've probably already slammed the door shut on your opponent before the games even really had a chance to get started."}, "Invigorating Hot Spring": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This reminds me of dropping Fires of Yavimaya back in the day. That means that your opponent can't ever properly play defense because they have no idea what is going to be coming at their face the next turn. Your creatures being slightly bigger than on normal curve and triggering modified for other cards are just gravy on top of the haste."}, "Enthusiastic Mechanaut": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I'm very enthusiastic about playing a cheap, evasive threat that reduces the cost of my other artifacts.  Not much more to say about this one other than the flavor text is a real win."}, "Colossal Skyturtle": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "If Mahamoti Djinn, Regrowth, and Unsummon somehow had a weird giant turtle baby. This provides a lot of different options for one mana too much, but that's a low cost to pay for all the versatility it provides."}, "Spirit-Sister's Call": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I've read this card at least thirty times. I'm pretty sure I know exactly how its supposed to work, I just don't know if it's actually any good. Sacrificing your worst creature to bring back your best one sounds great in theory, but it does cost five mana and require the right setup so maybe you should let someone else answer this call."}, "Satsuki, the Living Lore": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I'm unimpressed with Satsuki because she's only really good with sagas and she's not an enchantment creature. I think this could have had some really interesting game play decisions if you could have activated her as an instant. Maybe I'm expecting too much out of a two mana creature, but I'm not taking her unless I am already firmly entrenched in the enchantment deck."}, "Prodigy's Prototype": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This really doesn't do \u201cthat\u201d much more than the common vehicles that are easier to cast. Sure producing a pilot every turn you attack sounds great, but the lack of evasion will prevent getting too many attacks in with it. Even though it does trigger on other vehicles attacking, how many of them can you realistically play."}, "Oni-Cult Anvil": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "A slightly less annoying version of the cat oven combo since you only get the replacement 1/1 if it dies during your turn. Disgusting in multiples and doesn't really require that many other artifacts in your deck to be good."}, "Asari Captain": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "O captain! My captain! Why do you only have three toughness? The haste lets your surprise your opponent with a large samurai hopefully alongside a pile of \u201cexalted\u201d triggers. Unfortunately, it is pretty flimsy so you need to back this up with some solid tricks or they'll end up being a one hit wonder."}, "The Kami War": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Queue up the memes. Obviously, this is busted if you manage to pull it off and it's not entirely out of the realm of possibility between Ecologist's Terrarium and all the dual lands. In most cases you will just be staring at this in your hand."}, "Hidetsugu Consumes All": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This card is a fine sideboard card against an opponent playing a bunch of one drops, but since it's a mythic rare you are never going to see this late enough to want to take it. Arena problems right? You're probably not going to win many games where your three drop is only a 3/3 that comes wandering into the office two turns later, but that's what you are signing up for in most cases when you play this."}, "Eiganjo Uprising": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "If you are looking for a finisher that is going to be hanging out in your hand all game, then let me give you this pamphlet telling you about the wonders of joining the Eiganjo Uprising. The fail case of a 2/2 haste for three is a bad Daybreak Combatants, otherwise you are going to come out pretty even if you don't kill them with this. I've already given this the award for \u201cCard with the most math fails\u201d of the set."}, "Kairi, the Swirling Sky": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This has the least spectacular of the death triggers out of this cycle, but makes up for it by being an absolute brick house. Ward three is really hard to deal with when you have a 6/6 flyer coming at your face."}, "Jin-Gitaxias, Progress Tyrant": {"Rate": "4.5", "Desc": "This is going to lead to a lot of fun games\u2026 The best ways to get out of this are to either be far enough ahead that a seven mana 5/5 doesn't really matter or to play a cheap artifact followed up by a removal spell. If you can't do either of those, welcome to Phyrexia it's going to be a bumpy ride."}, "Tezzeret, Betrayer of Flesh": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Another amazing four mana planeswalker that can protect itself and rack up the card advantage. The only drawback here is that you need to have artifacts to make this work which shouldn't ever be a problem in this set."}, "Mindlink Mech": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Great flavor on a great card. 4/3 flyer for only three mana with the upside of copying abilities from its crew. This hits hard and it hits fast. Did I forget to mention that this only costs one to crew."}, "Invoke The Winds": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Another of the powerful, but worth it cycle with four pips in the casting cost. Control Magic effects are always powerful in limited and this one adds in the bonus of getting to untap it so you suddenly have their best blocker if you were on the backfoot. It also gets a bonus for not being an enchantment in a set where people will be playing removal for that. Unfortunately I am going to have to grade this as if it cost at least seven mana."}, "Behold the Unspeakable": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "I'm perfectly willing to behold this no matter how unspeakable it claims to be. The first ability negates one of the biggest problems with tapping out for a card draw spell by keeping the heat off you the turn you drop it. Then you pull ahead on cards and get a decent sized critter with flying and trample. I'm in."}, "Tameshi, Reality Architect": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This is a great late game engine as long as you have enough artifacts and enchantments to bring back with it. It does require there to be a target in the graveyard so you can't just bounce a land to draw a card. I'd recommend trying to prioritize trading off saga creatures or equipment creatures earlier in the game before dropping this to go to value town. "}, "The Reality Chip": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "The Reality Chip clogs up the ground early providing you are willing to block with this and lets you go off once it's equipped to a creature. Good early, great late which is all you can really ask out of a two drop. Comically enough this doesn't have defender so you can attack in and ninjitsu it."}, "Thousand-Faced Shadow": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I'm excited to draft this card and do ridiculous things while I get my ninja on. Wonderful enabler early and then comes right back to give you a free clone before being bounced again for another ninja. This looks underwhelming at first glance so it is a good candidate to be underrated early."}, "Tamiyo's Compleation": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "The usual blue tap down pacifism effect for four mana. While that effect has been pretty controversial for the last few sets, this one does throw in removing all abilities. On top of that it can hit artifacts, creatures, or even planeswalkers all at instant speed. These will probably be undervalued early in the format so get them while they're hot. "}, "Replication Specialist": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "It's not completely embarrassing to play a 3/4 flyer for five as long as you get something thrown in. So what does this specialize in? Doubling up every artifact you play including some of those juicy equipment creatures. Now that's a bonus effect that I'm into."}, "Network Disruptor": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This is the ultimate early ninjitsu enabler. Every ninjitsu deck is going to want a few of these as it just does so much for you for so small of an investment. Whether it's an evasive one drop going unblocked or tapping down a blocker to let your ninjas get another hit in, this is going to get a lot of groans out of your opponent. Don't be the person sleeping on one drops in limited, play this card."}, "Moonsnare Specialist": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I love Man-o'-War creatures and they have historically been a beating in every limited environment. This one gives you the option of either paying an extra mana or playing it for the going rate as a ninja. It even gives you the opportunity to bounce a creature that was part of a bad block for you when you ninjitsu it in."}, "Moon-Circuit Hacker": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Great card early that replaces itself if you have a cheap ninjitsu enabler. Later in the game, it's going to be hard for a 2/1 to do much of anything leaving this as a curve filler with upside."}, "Inventive Iteration": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "The first step letting you pull even on tempo is pretty key for not falling behind when you drop a saga. Getting a little card advantage and eventually a phantom monster with an annoying ability is worth the wait here. Unless you see your opponents hand, it's going to be a guessing game of playing the right mana cost spell to shut them down, but by the time you get to the creature it's free real estate."}, "Thirst for Knowledge": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This is the only card in the set that used to be restricted in vintage so you might say it's slightly above average. Bad jokes aside, I think this will be slightly worse than it was in Mirrodin because there aren't artifact lands to pitch to it. Being card filtering instead of advantage unless you pitch an actual artifact to it is a very real drawback."}, "Skyswimmer Koi": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Hey it's our common Phantom Monster of the set. Similar to Cruel Witness this offers solid card selection on an on rate evasive threat. I'm always down to have a couple of these in my deck."}, "Prosperous Thief": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Dropping this thief on turn two lets might let you steal the game from your opponent.  The treasures actually come from any ninja so you can quickly pull ahead with the right cards backing this up.

It just brick walls so many cards early and while this one doesn't pump, it does start getting you scry value after you stabilize."}, "Mobilizer Mech": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Really goes up in value if you have other vehicles that can benefit from the free crew.  Crew three isn't nearly as hard to do as it was in other sets because of all the pilots that crew for two higher floating around."}, "Mnemonic Sphere": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "A modernized version of Hieroglyphic Illumination that can be spread out over two turns while still offering the option to cycle it away for a single blue mana. It also helps enable artifact synergies and lets you hold up counter mana while waiting to be popped. Combos very well with Disruption Protocol by letting you hold up only two mana to either counter a spell or draw two cards."}, "Mirrorshell Crab": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I know you are all looking at this thinking I lost my mind by saying this is playable. Here's the thing, I really don't mind playing one of these because it's a restricted counter early that can just be a massive monster later in the game. I don't ever want to play more than one, but that one should handle some business."}, "Futurist Operative": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This is a great ninjitsu enabler that has the option to hit in for three unblockable damage with pseudo vigilance. It can be pretty mana intensive, but you can also leave the untap up as a threat of activation while also holding up counterspells or card draw."}, "Acquisition Octopus": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "It's going to be difficult to profitably attack with this early unless your opponent is on the saga train or kept a questionable hand. One underrated part of creatures that draw a card when they deal damage is that they actually play great defense because your opponent never wants to give up a free card. The real value is being able to put this on an evasive creature later to get the value train rolling."}, "Suit Up": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "They may have finally found the sweet spot on making Serpentine Ambush type cards playable.

The channel ability is pretty solid though and will dictate the actual value of this card."}, "The Modern Age": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "The early looting can get you out of some sticky land situations and a 2/3 flyer is never really worthless. The biggest problem is that even if you play this on turn two, you don't get to attack with this until turn five."}, "Futurist Sentinel": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "It may not have any abilities, but a 6/6 for only four mana ain't no joke.

Too narrow to ever play in the main, but a possible sideboard card against a saga heavy deck."}, "Short Circuit": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This is much worse than the other pacifism effects in the format.

As a lover of Bonesplitter this brings back fond memories of pummeling my opponents before they really had a chance to set up. If you equip this to a flyer on turn two, they either have a very quick clock on them or they deal with the creature which makes this give flying too.

This is a bomb that people might not realize is absurd."}, "Reckoner Bankbuster": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Card advantage built into your beater all for the low, low cost of two colorless mana.

I hope I really don't need to explain this more."}, "Surgehacker Mech": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Even if you don't have any other vehicles out, Surgehacker Mech still hits for two which kills almost half the creatures in the format. The crew cost is really high if you don't have pilots sitting around so it's not a slam dunk first pick."}, "Circuit Mender": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "I'm calling it right now, this will be my most drafted uncommon in Neon Dynasty. Outside of being colorless, this group of abilities fits well in pretty much every deck in the format.

As it is, it's just fine and will make the cut in most decks. Even if you don't have a crew, you can still drop this early to tap down their attacker preventing them from starting their early ninjitsu value train. Later on, it's a cheap flyer so it should still be relevant on most board states."}, "Ecologist's Terrarium": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Being colorless is a huge benefit to this because you aren't relying on drawing a specific color to be able to play your mana fixing. While the secondary ability is pretty unremarkable, it already replaced itself while thinning out your deck as a bonus. I'm going to be playing this in every deck except low curve aggressive ones."}, "Containment Construct": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "If Containment Construct would have been in Crimson Vow, it would have done way dirtier things than I can even begin to imagine. In Neon Dynasty it really depends on how many channel cards you have that can be reasonably played in the same turn as you channel them. The cards you're discarding also have to be worth the effort of waiting. Still a cheap creature with a low opportunity cost of adding it to your deck."}, "Thundersteel Colossus": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Another meme card that can be legitimately good in the right deck. Don't try to do something crazy with Anchor to Reality, but if you need a big finisher for your durdle deck this fits the bill.   "}, "Searchlight Companion": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "If you're searching for a ninjitsu enabler, then shine your light on this companion.

I have to put the reminder on this that spirit tokens don't fly in Kamigawa."}, "Patchwork Automaton": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "You really need a lot of cheap artifacts to even consider putting this into your deck. It takes two more artifacts to begin to feel \u201cahead\u201d on this and it requires playing it early enough to be effective at all. That's a lot of downsides for a card that doesn't feel insane even on its best draws."}, "Papercraft Decoy": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "I really don't like having to hold up two mana all the time for the chance of drawing a card with this. It should attack pretty freely in the early stages as your opponent won't want to let you get the free value off of a trade, but even in that scenario they may decide they'd rather tie up your mana so you can't develop your board. If you're short on playables, then sure go ahead and run this."}, "Network Terminal": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This reminds me of a knockoff version of The Celestus that I got off wish.com. I think this is a totally fine card that will overperform in a long game by keeping the gas flowing, but it's hard to win in modern limited when you play a do nothing on turn three. It also combos with Containment Construct which both provides the necessary artifact and lets you keep the card you loot away."}, "Mechtitan Core": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This was extremely overrated when it was first spoiled, but I think people have cooled down on it after realizing how hard it is to form Voltron. The majority of the time it is just a 2/4 for two that requires a crew 2 and that's nothing special."}, "Brute Suit": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Unless you have a ton of synergies and are desperate for vehicles, you can probably do better than this. Vigilance isn't really that great on a vehicle because you have to have a pilot for the turn you attack and then another pilot to cover for his lunch break while you're on defense. Three toughness also leaves this vulnerable to being easily blocked or removed. I'm proud of myself for not making a brutal pun here."}, "Shrine Steward": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "There are decks this is playable in, but it's a common with a very niche ability. If you are the one who wants it, you will end up getting it so just let it wheel back to you."}, "Runaway Trash-Bot": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This isn't total trash, but it's pretty close to it. Its best use is to hold down the fort early and maybe attack for three later in the game. Not what I'm looking to do."}, "Iron Apprentice": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "A slight improvement on Arcbound Worker by allowing the counter to move to any creature. It's another card where being a leaves the battlefield trigger instead of a dies would have made it at least a full grade higher. There just aren't enough synergies to really do anything with it."}, "Dramatist's Puppet": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "I shouldn't be so dramatic when talking about how bad this card is, but it's pretty awful. A 2/4 for four that only performs its minor ability if there is already a counter on something else isn't where you want to be."}, "Bronze Cudgels": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "Do you really, really need a cheap way to modify a creature? If not then I would avoid these like the plague. If the game goes really late this can be a decent mana sink, but in most cases you brought a couple of sticks to a mech fight."}, "Automated Artificer": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "The usual 1/3 for two that situationally produces mana and typically only makes the cut when your deck didn't quite get there. Fair warning, these abilities get dunked on by the Arena autotapper so make sure you tap this manually if you are about to double spell because otherwise you are going to get wrecked."}, "Reito Sentinel": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "The only good thing I can say about this card is that at least it's an uncommon so I don't end up with 4 of them in my sideboard every draft."}, "Mirror Box": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Remember that super sweet deck you drafted with eight legends and six of the same amazing common? Neither do I. There are times when this does something, but that something isn't worth it.

This one tosses in exile in exchange for being sorcery speed.

Great card that I will gladly take when I see it."}, "March of Wretched Sorrow": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This is a slightly overcosted removal spell that has the potential to swing a race all on it's own. The instant speed coupled with the life gain is going to destroy an opponent who unknowingly swung into this. While it's highly unlikely you use the option to exile cards to reduce the cost, it is always nice to have in case of emergency."}, "Blade of the Oni": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "Now this is an equipment creature that I would love to open! A 3/1 menace for two is a card I would play in every deck so anything beyond that is just free real estate. Later in the game this just starts demonizing your dorks to bash your opponents face in as a 5/5 Menace. The only real drawback is that one toughness leaves it fairly vulnerable to removal."}, "Assassin's Ink": {"Rate": "4.0", "Desc": "This is an amazing instant speed catch all removal spell whether or not you have either cost reduction active. In Neon Dynasty you are almost always going to have an artifact or enchantment out making this Heroes Downfall with the potential upside to be even cheaper. Usual disclaimer to use instant speed removal before blockers so you don't get wrecked by ninjitsu."}, "Tatsunari, Toad Rider": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "Tatsunari produces some serious value as long as you have some enchantments in your deck. If you played any Crimson Vow, you remember how far ahead you pulled when you sacrificed Biolume Egg on turn four.

The backside of this is certainly nothing to write home about especially when you get it turn four at the earliest."}, "Biting-Palm Ninja": {"Rate": "3.5", "Desc": "This ninja gets around the usual discard drawback of them being out of cards by giving you the option to just keep the menace counter on him instead. He doesn't even require a ninjitsu enabler as just dropping this guy on turn three will usually give him a free lane to crack in on the next turn."}, "Twisted Embrace": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "In most cases this is just going to be sorcery speed four mana removal with a little bonus thrown in. That's phenomenal when you are the beatdown and they are tapped out, but something just feels wrong about possibly losing your removal spell and a creature to an opposing removal."}, "Tribute to Horobi": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "It sure was awfully nice of you to give some free creatures to your opponent so they could ninjitsu your face off. As long as you have some plan to mitigate that problem, the backside of this is a bargain for only two mana.

It can even target itself to gain some life when you ninjitsu it in on turn two. It's important to note that it's ability doesn't require the ninjitsu cost to be paid so you can just play it to hook a creature up before combat."}, "Nashi, Moon Sage's Scion": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "This card is going to have one of the biggest deltas in performance based off what flips when it hits. If you pay six life and drop a huge bomb off it, the game is pretty much over while if you hit two land you just spent four mana and bounced your unblocked creature to deal three damage. The fragility of being a 3/2 means that, barring extraneous circumstances, this is only going to get that one hit in."}, "Mukotai Soulripper": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Dropping this on turn two can be a nightmare scenario for your opponent. If you follow it up with channeling Born to Drive , you have pilots and enough sac fodder to keep this menacing monster growing."}, "Lethal Exploit": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I'm always down for cheap removal that can also act as a combat trick by shrinking your opponents creature. While totally fine at the going rate of -2-2 for two mana, this has the potential to hit something much bigger if you have some modified creatures hanging around."}, "Gravelighter": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "Ninjitsu will incentivize your opponent to make early trades letting you get some extra value off of this. If they decline to block, you can still force a sacrifice trade that your opponent already showed they didn't want to make. Being an evasive threat makes it easy to bounce this with a ninja and lets you start the fun all over again."}, "Virus Beetle": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Burglar Rat and their brethren have always been annoying and playable cards in limited. They also have the bonus of being a bad creature that your opponent doesn't want to trade for since you already got a card off of it. This beetle also has the benefit of making them hold back a blocker because they never want to let you ninjitsu it back for another free card. On top of all that, this is an artifact so you are only an enchantment away from all of those sweet synergies."}, "Unforgiving One": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "While a 2/3 menace for three does teeter on edge of playability, this one does play well with the themes of the set. Ninjitsu benefits from menace and if you have enough modifications around this can turn into a must deal with value engine."}, "Return to Action": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "I know we're used to paying one mana for these return to the battlefield effects, but the lifelink and the extra power can do some real work.

Even with cycling or other effects you always have that \u201cwhat if it's just a land\u201d decision you have to make before playing it. This lets you take a peep, see they only have a land chilling, and bash in with your suddenly large monster. Of note, it's not even required to take the card if they do have something so you can always pump up the jams if you need to."}, "Okiba Salvage": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "Without the bonus this is a pretty meh card that really depends on what else you have in your deck to bring back with it.

It's not even worthless later in the game since you still get a couple of drains off of it."}, "Nezumi Bladeblesser": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This rating is assuming that you have a decent number of artifacts and enchantments in your deck. The combination of menace and deathtouch mitigates some of the problems with attacking with a two toughness creature.

It's rarely ever going to get to hit more than once so treat it like it's a one-off removal spell in your hand. Requiring discarding an actual creature is a very real cost, but you do have the option to pitch the one you just brought back to ninjitsu this in."}, "Dockside Chef": {"Rate": "2.5", "Desc": "This is so much better than similar effects by not requiring him to tap to use his ability.

The life gain is fairly negligible when you are preferably going to be sacrificing something cheap and insignificant."}, "Mukotai Ambusher": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "I've made my distaste for three mana aggressive creatures with only two toughness well known. So it's going to take a lot more than lifelink for me to want to play a four mana one.

It's worth playing if you don't have to twist your manabase too much, but don't despair if it doesn't make the cut.

Letting your opponent decide which creature to sacrifice means you are always getting their worst creature unless you happen to catch them with their pants down.

I would have preferred that it gave trample instead of untapped, but it is what it is."}, "Bearer of Memory": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Six mana is an awful lot to put a +1/+1 counter on a creature with a stat line I'm not interested in playing. At least it can target other enchantment creatures and provide trample, but still not likely to make the cut."}, "Bamboo Grove Archer": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "This is a strong sideboard card that will occasionally sneak its way into a few main decks. If you've got a strong endgame and need a way to get there, you could do worse than using this to hold down the fort."}, "Azusa's Many Journeys": {"Rate": "2.0", "Desc": "Azusa can go on as my journeys as she wants, I'm going to stay on the couch without her. It's totally fine to play this on curve as that extra land drop can be insane when you're on the play. Unfortunately, later on \u201cat least I still get a 3/3 in a couple of turns\u201d is pretty awful."}, "Tamiyo's Safekeeping": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "Two life is no replacement for the +1+1 counter of Snakeskin Veil  especially in the set with modified. It is cheap, but Arena is going to rat you out for having this right away since it can target any permanent."}, "Grafted Growth": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This card is kind of at odds with itself as the counter is more beneficial in aggressive decks while the extra mana is better in a ramp deck. The one thing this does do quite well is help you cast the four colored pip rare cycle."}, "Go-Shintai of Boundless Vigor": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "This grows way too slowly to want to play it in anything other than a board stall. I guess it gets bumped up half a grade if you have another shrine."}, "The Dragon-Kami Reborn": {"Rate": "1.5", "Desc": "Unless you are dropping the ultimate meme with The Kami War this card is not worth it. Three mana do nothing for two turns before turning into an egg that does nothing until it dies seems like a good way to punt away the game. Even if they don't have a way to exile it or evasive attackers to go around it, you still had to hit something worth playing in those first two steps. That's not an omelet worth making."}, "Historian's Wisdom": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "If you already have the biggest creature on the board, does paying three mana to give it +2+1 really matter? Not worth taking the chance of the blowout especially with the card draw being situational."}, "Commune with Spirits": {"Rate": "1.0", "Desc": "Are you in the market for paying a mana and discarding a card turn one? If not, then I wouldn't recommend playing this card. Sure it has a good possibility of hitting, but what it does is so unspectacular that it's not worth taking the chance you miss."}, "March of Burgeoning Life": {"Rate": "0.0", "Desc": "BAHAHAHA, One With Nothing you have finally met your match. This is seriously one of the worst limited cards that has ever been printed. Every time you read this card, it somehow gets worse. Just no."}, "Scoured Barrens": {"Rate": "3.0", "Desc": "I'm just going to address all of the dual lands at once because no one wants to read the same thing ten times. People don't realize how bad their mana normally is in limited and these help prevent non-games from happening. Take them as a 3.0 if they are in your colors and a 3.5 if they help you with a splash."}};
